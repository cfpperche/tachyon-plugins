# Step 12 — Legal Posture

**Goal:** the founder's articulated legal posture for v1 — terms model, privacy stance (regulation applicability + data flows + retention), data-handling commitments, license choices (own license + OSS components), regulated-aspect treatments, and AI-specific posture when applicable. This is a synthesis document — a structured inventory the founder hands to outside counsel for a productive 30-minute conversation, NOT a substitute for the actual terms / privacy policy / DPA artifacts that qualified counsel must draft.

**Mode:** `synthesis` with `delegable: true`. Fully delegable — the sub-agent reads prior artifacts (PRD + system-design + cost-estimate + roadmap + brand) and produces the posture document with no live parent interview. The product class + jurisdiction + stack signals are extracted from the prior artifacts mechanically; the posture is a structural inventory anchored against those signals.

**Output file:** `legal-posture.md` in `docs/`. Single-artifact — no `extra_files`.

**Gate behavior:** step 12 closes the Specification phase gate (the pipeline's gates fire after steps 4, 7, and 12). After a clean write, the step closes the Specification phase's gate — the orchestrator pauses at the gate before advancing. Parent confirms with user, records the Specification gate as passed in `.state.json.gates_passed` (only after the user explicitly confirms the phase is ready to close), then advances `.state.json` again to enter step 13 (prototype-v3 — the visual contract). Step 12 is NOT the final step — step 13 closes the pipeline.

## How to conduct this step

Read `references/privacy-matrix-shape.md` for the controller-vs-processor framing + GDPR / LGPD / CCPA matrix shape + sub-processor disclosure discipline + 72-hour breach notification (GDPR Art 33) + DPIA trigger heuristics (high-risk processing under GDPR Art 35). Read `references/oss-license-matrix.md` for the MIT / Apache 2.0 / LGPL / GPL / AGPL compatibility table + SaaS implications (AGPL network copyleft is the load-bearing warning) + license-choice rationale. Read `references/regulated-aspects-checklist.md` for the HIPAA / COPPA / PCI / SOC 2 / GLBA / FERPA / AI Act trigger + posture-decision-per-trigger + when-to-engage-counsel discipline.

### 1. Read everything prior

- **PRD** — `docs/prd/v1.md` — § Users / Audience drives the regulation applicability (EU residents → GDPR; California residents → CCPA / CPRA; Brazil residents → LGPD; minors → COPPA / GDPR Art 8; employees → state employment privacy laws); § Goals + § Success Metrics drive the v1 user-volume estimate (drives DPIA trigger — large-scale processing under GDPR Art 35); § User Stories drive what data is collected per flow.
- **System design** — `docs/system-design.md` — § Data Model is the authoritative source for what PII is collected; § Integrations names every third-party sub-processor (Stripe, Auth0 / Supabase, OpenAI / Anthropic, Sentry, PostHog, SendGrid / Resend, etc); § Stack drives OSS-component inventory (every npm / cargo / pip dependency in production is a license-compatibility question); § Deployment drives data-residency posture (US-region vs EU-region vs multi-region); § Non-Functional § Security drives the encryption-at-rest / encryption-in-transit + backup-retention commitments.
- **Security** — `docs/security.md` — compliance posture (LGPD / GDPR / SOC 2 pre-work named here) drives § Regulated Aspects rows; OWASP threat-model surfaces the breach-notification context; auth model (OAuth scopes, session storage, MFA posture) drives the data-handling row on access controls.
- **Cost estimate** — `docs/cost-estimate.md` — § Run Cost line items include DPA fees + legal review allocation + (when applicable) SOC 2 audit fees + outside-counsel retainer; this anchors the timing of when counsel-review checkpoints fire in § Open Decisions.
- **Roadmap** — `docs/roadmap.md` — § Horizon § External coordination names the legal-review trigger week (typically late in Polish + Launch phase); § Open Decisions may carry a legal-related deferred decision (e.g. "EU region deferred to v2 — flip if first EU customer requests data residency").
- **Brand** — `docs/brand.md` — voice (consumer-friendly conversational vs enterprise-formal) calibrates the terms-of-service tone; a B2B SaaS targeting compliance teams must commit to enterprise-formal terms while a consumer mobile app can adopt plain-language ToS.
- **Architecture JSON** — `docs/data-flow.json` — quick scan confirms the sub-processor list count + the data-flow shape (does data flow to an LLM at runtime? if yes, AI-specific posture fires).

### 2. Extract the 4 structural signals

The sub-agent reads the prior artifacts and extracts four signals that calibrate the posture document. NO live parent interview — these are mechanically extracted, NOT interview questions:

1. **Product class.** Consumer mobile (1 persona, B2C, app-store distribution) / B2B SaaS (workspace per customer, contract terms govern) / Developer tool (API / CLI / SDK distribution) / AI-stack (LLM in production data flow) / Regulated-vertical (health / fintech / education / employment). May overlap — a B2B SaaS with AI features in an EU-employee-data context is three overlapping classes.

2. **Jurisdiction exposure.** Where do users live? Where is data stored? Where is the company incorporated? Extract from PRD § Users (audience) + system-design § Deployment (data-residency) + a default-by-class heuristic when neither artifact names it (consumer-US-only → CCPA + applicable state laws; consumer-global → GDPR + LGPD + CCPA + PIPEDA; B2B-SaaS-with-EU-customers → GDPR is mandatory; AI-stack-with-EU-users → AI Act provisions starting Aug 2026).

3. **Sub-processor stack.** From system-design § Integrations. Every third-party that receives personal data is a sub-processor under GDPR Art 28 / LGPD Art 39. The list is exhaustive — Stripe, OpenAI, Auth0, Sentry, PostHog, Resend, AWS, Vercel, etc. Each row gets a 1-line treatment (purpose + DPA citation + cross-border transfer mechanism).

4. **AI-in-stack signal.** Does data flow to an LLM or generative model? If yes (system-design § Integrations names OpenAI / Anthropic / Cohere / Mistral / a self-hosted model), the § AI-Specific section fires. If no, § AI-Specific is omitted entirely (NOT emitted as `*N/A*` — silent omission is the clean shape).

These four signals drive product-class calibration (§ 5 below), regulation-matrix coverage (§ 4 below), and conditional-section inclusion (§ AI-Specific fires only when signal 4 is yes).

### 3. The escape clause — TOP of document

```markdown
> **This is the founder's articulated legal posture for v1, NOT legal advice.** Counsel review is required before launch. Real lawyers write the actual Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Data Processing Agreement, and any regulated-aspect filings. This document exists to brief outside counsel and surface posture-level decisions the founder has made (or deliberately deferred).
```

Visibility matters — the escape clause sits at the TOP, NOT the bottom. This is the canonical counsel-disclaimer discipline.

### 4. The canonical posture structure

The sub-agent writes `legal-posture.md` against this 8-required spine (full shape lives in the references; AI-specific conditional fires only when signal 4 is yes — § 2 above):

1. **Overview** — short paragraph + 3 load-bearing one-liners (mirrors step-9 / 10 / 11 § Overview shape):
   - **Paragraph:** what's being articulated (v1 legal posture for outside-counsel briefing), which product class + jurisdiction exposure + AI-stack signal selected the calibration. Names the product class so depth-calibration is visible.
   - **Biggest legal risk:** one sentence naming THE posture decision most likely to require counsel rework. Anti-pattern: even-keeled risk distribution. Most v1 builds have ONE legal risk that dominates (employee-data-flowing-to-LLM, AGPL-component-in-SaaS-stack, EU-user-data-without-SCCs, COPPA-trigger-from-minor-users). Say it.
   - **Counsel-review timing:** one sentence naming WHEN outside counsel must engage (anchor against step-11 roadmap § Horizon § External coordination — typically late in Polish + Launch phase, 2-3 weeks before public launch).

2. **Terms of Service Posture** — what the v1 ToS commits to. NOT the actual ToS. Format:
   - **Acceptance model:** clickwrap (mandatory checkbox + "I agree" before account creation; the only defensible model for SaaS — browsewrap fails US enforceability tests) vs scroll-wrap (terms displayed in-app, acceptance is implicit-but-prompted). Default for B2B SaaS: clickwrap with a separate DPA acceptance flow for enterprise customers.
   - **Governing law:** jurisdiction (Delaware / California / UK / Brazil / EU) + venue (court vs arbitration; binding individual arbitration is the SaaS default in the US).
   - **Acceptable use:** the carve-outs (no scraping, no reverse-engineering, no using the service for illegal content, no spam). Concrete bullets, NOT "users must behave appropriately".
   - **Payment + cancellation:** subscription auto-renewal posture (the FTC's "Click-to-Cancel" rule applies for US consumer-facing subscriptions starting 2026); refund policy (pro-rata vs no-refund); chargeback handling.
   - **Limitation of liability + indemnification:** the cap (typically 12 months of fees paid, or $100, whichever is greater; B2B SaaS enterprise customers will negotiate this).
   - **Counsel-review checkpoint:** Outside counsel signs off on the actual ToS via 1-line email confirmation; the posture document does NOT substitute.

3. **Privacy Posture** — the regulation matrix + data flows + retention. The dense section. Format (subsectioned by user-flow when ≥3 distinct data-collection contexts exist — closes step-11's user-flow-shaped discipline):
   - **Applicable regulations.** Matrix table: `| Regulation | Trigger | Applicable? | Posture | Counsel review trigger |` — one row per relevant frame (GDPR for EU users; LGPD for Brazil users; CCPA / CPRA for California consumers; PIPEDA for Canada users; COPPA for minors under 13; HIPAA when health data; FERPA when education records).
   - **Controller vs processor role.** Declare per data flow — the company is *controller* for first-party data the user provides to use the product (account info, content the user creates); *processor* for data the customer's end-users generate when the product is B2B SaaS (customer is the controller, the company is the processor under DPA terms). Mixed models are common — explicit per-flow declaration prevents the "we're both controller and processor depending on context" ambiguity that fails GDPR Art 28 audits.
   - **Data categories + legal basis + retention table.** One row per data category: `| Data Category | Purpose | Legal Basis | Retention Period | Deletion Mechanism |`. Legal basis values: Consent (Art 6(1)(a)) / Contract (Art 6(1)(b)) / Legal Obligation (Art 6(1)(c)) / Vital Interest / Public Task / Legitimate Interest (Art 6(1)(f)). NOT "Consent for everything" — that's the dominant anti-pattern.
   - **Data subject rights — DSAR-window-per-regulation precision.** How users exercise access / deletion / portability / objection / rectification. Posture (in-app self-serve toggle vs email-to-DPO-then-SLA). The procedure exists; the actual UI / endpoint lives in the engineering spec (`/sdd new <slug>`). **DSAR response windows are per-regulation, NOT a blanket SLA** — GDPR Art 12: 30 days (extendable +60 for complex); LGPD Art 19: 15 days; CCPA / CPRA § 1798.130: 45 days (extendable +45); PIPEDA: 30 days. Default to the strictest applicable window when multiple regulations apply (typically LGPD's 15 days for products with any Brazilian user). Blanket "30-day response" is the regression mode — it under-serves LGPD subjects.
   - **GDPR article-grid matrix.** When GDPR applies AND the product is non-trivial (more than the smallest dev-tool class), include a sub-section table cross-referencing the load-bearing GDPR articles to implementation evidence: `| Article | Requirement | Applicable? | Control | Evidence location |`. Cover Articles 5 (principles) / 6 (lawful basis) / 7 (consent conditions) / 8 (child consent) / 12 (transparency) / 13 (info on data collection) / 14 (info when data not from subject) / 15-22 (data subject rights) / 24 (controller responsibility) / 25 (privacy by design) / 28 (processor / sub-processor) / 30 (records of processing) / 32 (security of processing) / 33 (72-hour breach to authority) / 34 (breach to data subject) / 35 (DPIA) / 37 (DPO designation) / 44-49 (international transfers). The fillable matrix template lives in `references/privacy-matrix-shape.md` § GDPR article-grid; the agent populates it with project-specific Control + Evidence-location entries. This grid is the reusable audit substrate counsel hands to enterprise customers during procurement.
   - **Cross-border transfers.** When data leaves the EU/UK/Brazil/etc, name the mechanism (Standard Contractual Clauses Module 2 for controller→processor; adequacy decision; Binding Corporate Rules). EU→US transfer without SCCs is the anti-pattern; even SaaS delivery counts as a transfer.
   - **DPIA trigger.** When high-risk processing fires (systematic monitoring; sensitive data at scale; automated decision-making; large-scale profiling — GDPR Art 35(3)). If any of these apply, DPIA is *mandatory before processing commences*. Mark `[DPIA Required]` inline; flag in § Open Decisions if not yet completed.

4. **Data Handling** — the technical-and-organizational measures. Format:
   - **Encryption posture:** at rest (AES-256 for database, encrypted secrets in environment variables) and in transit (TLS 1.3, HSTS enabled). Cite system-design § Non-Functional § Security for the actual implementation.
   - **Backup retention.** How long backups live; how they're rotated; how a user-deletion-request propagates to backups (typical posture: backups expire on a 30-day rotation; deletion requests are honored within the rotation window).
   - **Breach notification commitment.** 72-hour notification to supervisory authority (GDPR Art 33); without-undue-delay notification to affected data subjects (Art 34) when high risk. ANPD notification for LGPD breaches. Internal escalation playbook (who detects → who decides notification → who drafts the notice) lives in `security.md`; this section names the SLA commitment, NOT the playbook.
   - **Access controls.** Who internally accesses production data (engineering on-call only; support reads only the records the user references; full audit log per access). MFA mandatory for all production data access.
   - **Sub-processor disclosure.** Subsection table: `| Sub-processor | Purpose | Data Categories | DPA Reference | Cross-Border Mechanism |` — one row per third party. Stripe, Auth0/Supabase, OpenAI/Anthropic, Sentry, PostHog, Resend, AWS, Vercel/Neon. Each row cites the third party's published DPA. GDPR Art 28(2) requires the controller's general or specific prior authorization for each sub-processor — name them. **Sub-processor jurisdiction comes from `architecture.json` sub-component sublabel (e.g. PostHog `"cloud, EU region"`) OR cost-estimate § Run Cost source citation, NOT vendor HQ.** Listing PostHog as "UK" because Posthog Inc.'s HQ is in the UK when the architecture.json declares EU-Cloud regionalization is the regression the discipline catches — the regional deployment, not the corporate domicile, drives the cross-border mechanism column.
   - **Sub-processor row-lock to cost-estimate.** Sub-processor count MUST equal the cost-estimate § Run Cost vendor count. A 10-vendor cost-estimate produces a 10-row sub-processor table; a 6-vendor cost-estimate produces a 6-row table. Validator does NOT enforce this; the discipline is on the agent. Mismatches surface at counsel-review time as either "missing sub-processor" (Art 28(2) gap) or "ghost sub-processor" (referenced without a cost line — usually an artifact of the cost-estimate being out of date).

5. **Licensing** — own license + OSS components + patent posture + IP-assignment posture. Format:
   - **The product's own license.** For shipped product: MIT (most permissive, easy adoption — pick when the goal is broad ecosystem reuse) / Apache 2.0 (permissive with explicit patent grant — pick when the project will accept contributions from many parties) / AGPL v3 (network copyleft — pick when the goal is to force SaaS competitors to open-source their derivatives) / Proprietary / Source-Available (BUSL with delayed-open conversion) / commercial-only. The choice has consequences — see `references/oss-license-matrix.md`.
   - **OSS component compatibility.** Table: `| Component | License | Version | Use | Distribution Model | Copyleft Risk | Action Required |` — one row per critical OSS dependency. Flag any AGPL component in a SaaS stack as `Critical — network copyleft triggered`; recommend replacement or commercial license before launch. **Framework-level inventory is necessary but NOT sufficient — name the gap.** The agent acknowledges explicitly that the system-design § Stack table captures framework-level dependencies (Next.js, React, Prisma, …) while the actual `package-lock.json` / `Cargo.lock` / `poetry.lock` reality is 600-1500 transitive dependencies; a single AGPL-licensed transitive dep is the dominant probabilistic risk. The transitive audit (via `npx license-checker --excludePrivatePackages --onlyAllow 'MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;ISC;MPL-2.0;PostgreSQL'`, `cargo-license`, `pip-licenses`, `go-licenses`) is a § Open Decisions row with deciding signal = end of polish phase / before public launch — NOT a v1 inline action.
   - **License-choice rationale.** One paragraph explaining WHY the license was picked. Without rationale, the choice is decorative.
   - **Patent strategy posture.** Single-line guidance for software-only v1 stacks: **default posture is NO patent filings at pre-revenue stage due to Alice/Mayo § 101 prosecution risk; revisit at $5M ARR or when a true novel-method emerges.** Software algorithmic surfaces (keyboard routers, import-pipeline orchestrators, free-tier-cap enforcement) face Alice/Mayo § 101 abstract-idea rejection at high rates; prosecution cost ($10k-$50k per application) is not justified at pre-revenue scale. Hardware / biotech / true novel-method products carry distinct patent posture — those get a row in § Open Decisions, not the default-skip line. Patent posture omission is the CUT this paragraph fixes — "silent on patents" is the regression mode.
   - **IP Assignment posture.** Two artifacts the founder MUST execute (and v1 typically defers documentation of):
     - **Founder IP Assignment Agreement** — at entity formation, assigning all founder work-product (pre-incorporation code, designs, brand assets) to the company. Required for Series A IP-chain-of-title diligence; investors reject any unassigned-founder exposure.
     - **PIIA (Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement) for contractors and employees** — executed BEFORE first commit / first day, assigning work-product to the company and covering perpetual license + confidentiality. The roadmap's part-time designer / first-engineer-hire is the standard trigger. Retroactive PIIA is unenforceable in many jurisdictions.

     Both surface as explicit § Open Decisions rows with concrete deciding signals (Founder IPAA: "at entity formation, before any Company code is committed"; PIIA: "before the designer's first commit / first employee's first day") and `[counsel-review] [founder]` concern tags — NOT buried under § Regulated Aspects § Trade-secret as a sub-paragraph.

6. **Regulated Aspects** — the regulation triggers + posture per trigger. Conditional rows fire only when the trigger applies. Format:
   - **HIPAA** (when health data — PHI as defined under 45 CFR 160.103). Posture: covered-entity vs business-associate vs neither (most B2B SaaS that touches health data is BA; the customer is the CE). BAA mandatory. Encryption requirements stricter than baseline (FIPS 140-2 compliant).
   - **COPPA** (when minors under 13 are users — even if not the target audience, if minors are reasonably foreseeable). Posture: age-gate before account creation; verifiable parental consent for under-13 data collection; safe-harbor program (TRUSTe, iKeepSafe) opt-in.
   - **PCI DSS** (when payment-card data flows through the product). Posture: SAQ-A (Stripe-hosted redirect — minimal PCI scope; the default) vs SAQ-A-EP (tokenized iframe — moderate scope) vs SAQ-D (full card data — maximum scope, avoid for v1). Cite system-design § Integrations § Stripe for the integration mode.
   - **SOC 2** (when enterprise customers will require it — usually a Series A milestone, not v1). Posture: Type I readiness in v1 (controls documented + 6-month observation window starts); Type II at scale (audit fires after 6 months of evidence). Cost line in step-10 § Run Cost.
   - **GLBA** (when consumer financial data is collected — fintech). Posture: privacy notice mandatory; safeguards rule applies.
   - **FERPA** (when education records — student data). Posture: directory-information vs sensitive-record split; parental access rights.
   - **AI Act (EU)** (when AI is in the stack AND EU users are reached). Posture: high-risk AI system classification (most B2B SaaS LLM features are *limited-risk* under Art 52 — transparency obligations only; biometric / employment / education / law-enforcement use cases jump to *high-risk* with full conformity assessment). Article applicability begins August 2026.
   - **State employment privacy laws** (when employee data is collected — Illinois BIPA for biometrics, California CCPA for employee records since 2023, NY 2023 employment regulations).
   - **Trade-secret protection** (when proprietary algorithms / customer lists / pricing are material). Posture: NDAs with contractors signed BEFORE access; access controls; explicit confidentiality marking. Public disclosure (open-source release, conference talk, blog post) destroys trade-secret status — flag if any pre-launch disclosure happened.
   - **Trademark posture** (when brand name is material — most consumer-facing products). Posture: clearance search before launch (USPTO TESS + EU EUIPO eSearch); strength analysis (generic / descriptive / suggestive / fanciful — fanciful is strongest); filing strategy (USPTO + EUIPO Madrid System for international).

   Each row carries a posture sentence + a counsel-review trigger ("Outside counsel signs off on HIPAA BAA template via 1-line email before first health-data-flowing feature ships").

7. **AI-Specific** (conditional — fires only when AI-in-stack signal from § 2 is yes). Format:
   - **Training-data provenance.** What data the model was trained on (model vendor's training set; internal fine-tuning on customer data — the latter requires explicit consent and DPA carve-out). If the company fine-tunes on customer data, name the opt-in mechanism.
   - **Model-output liability.** Disclaimers in the ToS: outputs are AI-generated, may be inaccurate, must not be relied upon for medical / legal / financial decisions without independent verification. The disclaimer goes in the actual ToS; the posture lives here.
   - **User disclosure of AI involvement.** Visible in-product labeling when output is AI-generated (legally mandatory in some jurisdictions starting 2026 — California AB 2013, EU AI Act Art 52). Posture: in-product badge + ToS disclosure.
   - **Opt-out from model improvement.** Does the company use customer data to improve the model? If yes, named opt-out mechanism (settings toggle + DPA carve-out for enterprise). Default for B2B SaaS: opt-out by default; data NEVER used for model improvement without explicit opt-in.
   - **Vendor sub-processor disclosure.** OpenAI / Anthropic / Cohere / Mistral as sub-processors — DPA reference + cross-border transfer mechanism (most are US-resident; SCCs Module 2 applies for EU data).
   - **Output filtering posture.** Content moderation on outputs (PII redaction, harmful-content filtering). Cite the actual implementation in system-design § Integrations.

8. **Open Decisions — single consolidated table covering corporate + privacy + IP rows.** The legal-posture decisions the founder hasn't made yet that the document is parked on. Each row carries a deciding signal. Mirrors step-9 / 10 / 11 § Open Decisions discipline. **One unified table, NOT per-sub-section tables** — corporate (entity formation, ToS cap), privacy (DSAR runbook, EU residency, DPIA scope), and IP (license choice, transitive-dep audit, PIIA execution, Founder IPAA, patent posture re-evaluation) rows all live in this single § Open Decisions table. Per-sub-section sub-tables are the anti-pattern; consolidated is the discipline. Format:
   ```markdown
   | # | Decision | Default if no decision by | Deciding signal | Concern |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | 1 | Apache 2.0 vs MIT for the product's own license | end of week 4 (start of Polish phase) | Patent-grant concern: if v1 ships novel algorithms, Apache 2.0's explicit patent grant prevents downstream patent litigation; MIT silent on patents | [founder] [counsel-review] |
   | 2 | EU region deployment in v1 vs v2 | end of week 8 (mid Killer Flow) | First EU customer signs LOI or first design partner is EU-based; flip to v1 if either triggers | [founder] [engineering] |
   | 3 | DPIA scope — is OpenAI integration "large-scale automated decision-making" under GDPR Art 35? | end of week 6 (before Killer Flow demos to design partners) | If killer-flow uses LLM output to drive user-facing classification (issue triage, content moderation), DPIA fires; counsel confirms | [counsel-review] [product] |
   | 4 | Transitive-dependency audit via `license-checker` / `licensee` / `cargo-license` | end of polish phase / before public launch | Run `npx license-checker --excludePrivatePackages --onlyAllow 'MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;ISC;MPL-2.0;PostgreSQL'` (or stack-equivalent); fail-build CI gate added; flag any AGPL/GPL/LGPL/SSPL hit as `Critical — network copyleft triggered` | [engineering] [counsel-review] |
   | 5 | Founder IP Assignment Agreement execution | at entity formation, before any Company code is committed | Delaware Certificate of Incorporation filed → counsel supplies template → founder executes → file in cap-table records | [founder] [counsel-review] |
   | 6 | Contractor PIIA template execution | before the first contractor's / part-time hire's first commit | Roadmap names a part-time designer or first-engineer hire — execute PIIA before that person merges any code | [founder] [counsel-review] |
   | 7 | Patent posture re-evaluation | $5M ARR OR first genuinely-novel algorithmic differentiation surfaces | Default v1 posture is no filings (Alice/Mayo § 101 prosecution risk); re-evaluate at the revenue / novelty signal | [founder] [counsel-review] |
   ```
   4-8 rows is the target for a B2B SaaS at v1 (was previously 2-4 — the IP-assignment + transitive-audit + patent-posture rows added by the step-12 calibration push the floor up by ~3 rows). Concern tags use the step-11 allow-list extended with `[counsel-review]` for legal-discipline rows.

   **§ Risks consolidation rule mirrors § Open Decisions.** When the posture document includes a § Risks table (probability × impact × mitigation), it is ALSO a single consolidated table covering corporate (entity-formation gap, ToS cap rejected), privacy (DSAR-SLA-breach, breach-notification-SOP-gap, controller-vs-processor audit fail), and IP (transitive AGPL surfaces, trademark conflict, unassigned-contractor IP) rows. Per-discipline sub-risk-tables are the anti-pattern.

### 5. Calibrate by product class (smart, not rigid)

Mirrors step-9 / 10 / 11 calibration ladder. **Posture depth + section emphasis scale with product class:**

| Product class | legal-posture.md depth | Sections of emphasis | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Micro-Product / CLI helper / dev-tool with no auth** | Compact ~6 KB | Terms + Licensing only; § Privacy degenerates (no PII collected) | When the product collects ZERO PII, § Privacy + § Data Handling + § Sub-Processors collapse to single line each: `*No PII collected; section degenerates*`. § Licensing becomes the dominant section. |
| **Consumer Mobile App (1 persona, B2C)** | Standard ~9 KB | Privacy (CCPA + COPPA loudly; GDPR if global) + Data Handling | App-store-policy compliance is implicit (Apple ATT, Google Play Data Safety) — name as a § Regulated Aspects row. § Terms emphasises clickwrap-at-signup. |
| **B2B SaaS (the default)** | Full ~9-11 KB | Privacy + Data Handling + Sub-Processors + Regulated Aspects (SOC 2 prep) | DPA mandatory for enterprise customers; controller-vs-processor split is the dominant framing. SCCs for EU data flows. § Open Decisions usually carries SOC 2 timing + EU residency decisions. |
| **Developer Tool / API-first** | Standard ~8 KB | Licensing (OSS license choice is dominant) + Terms (API ToS) | If SDK is published, OSS license rationale section expands. § Sub-Processors light unless the tool transits customer data through hosted infra. |
| **AI-stack (LLM in production data flow)** | Expanded ~11-13 KB | + § AI-Specific fires + AI Act row in § Regulated Aspects | All of B2B SaaS depth PLUS the AI-specific section. Training-data + opt-out + output filtering posture mandatory. AI Act applicability triggers in Aug 2026 — name it. |
| **Regulated Vertical (health / fintech / education / employment)** | Expanded ~12-15 KB | + dedicated row per applicable regime in § Regulated Aspects + BAA/SAQ-A/FERPA-DPA-shape posture | HIPAA / GLBA / FERPA / BIPA each get their own posture row. § Privacy controller-vs-processor matters even more — health-data BA model under HIPAA is distinct from GDPR controller-vs-processor framing. |

Signal extraction ambiguous → default to **B2B SaaS Full (9-11 KB)**. Mark the chosen class in § Overview opening sentence (`v1 legal posture for a B2B SaaS with AI-stack — 11-section full template applied (AI-Specific fires).`).

Product classes overlap. A B2B SaaS for EU healthcare clinics with AI-driven triage is **B2B SaaS + AI-stack + Regulated Vertical (HIPAA + GDPR + AI Act)** — depth expands to ~14 KB and § Regulated Aspects carries 4-5 rows. Calibration is *additive* across overlapping classes, not exclusive.

### 6. Concern tags (inherited from step-11)

Deliverable / decision rows MAY carry a bracketed cross-functional concern tag. Step-11's allow-list extended with `[counsel-review]`:

- `[engineering]` / `[product+engineering]` / `[product]` / `[design]` / `[founder]` — step-11 allow-list
- `[counsel-review]` — NEW for step 12. Signals that the row requires outside counsel sign-off before the posture commits. Examples: BAA template approval, AGPL component removal sign-off, DPIA scope confirmation.

Tags are OPTIONAL — omit when single-discipline. Don't invent new tags.

### 7. Real-human acceptance discipline (inherited from step-11)

At least one row per major section SHOULD anchor to a real human role — "Outside counsel signs off on HIPAA BAA template via 1-line email confirmation before first health-data feature ships" / "DPO reviews § Privacy Posture and signs off via written confirmation before launch" / "Founder confirms § Regulated Aspects § AI Act posture against the most-recent EU AI Act guidance with outside counsel". CI-only / artifact-presence checks are necessary-but-not-sufficient; a named human signoff is the contract.

### 8. Step-4 finding-ID lineage (inherited from step-11)

The § Privacy Posture data-categories table MAY cite step-4 (validation) finding IDs in a `Source` column when the row resolves a finding — e.g. a clarity-of-consent UI finding from step 4 (`F-08: users didn't understand the consent dialog; recommended explicit purpose breakdown`) traces forward to the § Privacy Posture row that names per-purpose consent. Citation shape: `step 4 § Findings § F-08 resolved`. Opportunistic — skip when no step-4 finding applies.

### 9. Submit + gate

Write `legal-posture.md` (the full posture) to `docs/` — but ONLY after the step's Layer-1 validation passes; write the artifact atomically (mktemp + rename) so it lands whole or not at all. Single-artifact step — no companion files.

Schema enforces section presence + Layer 1 contains/size floors (literal H2 anchors + at least 2 markdown-table-header literals + the `[counsel-review]` concern-tag literal as the calibration anchor). On success, advancing `.state.json` closes the Specification phase's gate — the orchestrator pauses at the gate before advancing (the pipeline's gates fire after steps 4, 7, and 12). Parent asks the user to confirm Specification phase is ready to close, records the Specification gate as passed in `.state.json.gates_passed`, then advances `.state.json` again to enter step 13 (prototype-v3 — the visual contract).

**Step 12 is NOT the final step.** Step 13 (prototype-v3) closes the pipeline. Step 13 (prototype-v3) does NOT close a phase — it's the in-phase final deliverable of specification; after step 13, the pipeline completes and surfaces the SDD handoff (`/sdd new <slug>`). Step 12 closes the gate; step 13 closes the pipeline.

## Voice & rigor

- **The escape clause is at the TOP, not the bottom.** Visibility matters. A founder reading this document with their attention waning at section 6 must STILL have seen the "not legal advice" framing.
- **This artifact briefs counsel — it does not replace counsel.** Write it in a way a non-lawyer founder can hand to their lawyer for a productive 30-minute conversation. The lawyer drafts the actual ToS / Privacy Policy / DPA / regulated-aspect filings. The posture document surfaces decisions; the artifacts execute them.
- **Cite the system-design integrations explicitly.** "Stripe (system-design § Integrations § Payments) — Stripe's published DPA applies; PCI scope reduced to SAQ-A via redirect/tokenization model." NOT "we use Stripe for payments". The citation is the audit trail; without it the row is unanchored.
- **Regulated-aspect callouts are mandatory if any apply.** Don't bury them. "This product collects health data (PRD § Users — fitness coaching with biometric heart-rate input) — HIPAA may apply; counsel must confirm whether covered-entity vs business-associate model fits BEFORE first health-data feature ships." The row exists OR doesn't — silent omission is the regression mode the discipline catches.
- **Open-source license choice is deliberate, with rationale.** MIT / Apache 2.0 / AGPL each have downstream consequences; pick with reasoning, NOT by default. "Apache 2.0 because v1 ships a novel ranking algorithm; the explicit patent grant prevents downstream patent litigation against the company and against contributors." Without the rationale, the license is decorative — and license choice has 10-year consequences.
- **AGPL components in SaaS stacks are the load-bearing OSS risk.** AGPL's network copyleft is triggered by SaaS delivery — any AGPL component requires source disclosure OR a commercial license. Flag at § Licensing § OSS components with `Critical — network copyleft triggered`.
- **Controller-vs-processor declaration is per-flow, not per-product.** A B2B SaaS is *controller* for first-party data the user provides (account email, billing address) AND *processor* for second-party data the customer's end-users generate (workspace content, customer-end-user usage events). Declare per data flow. The "we're both" ambiguity is the GDPR Art 28 audit failure mode.
- **Consent is not the default legal basis.** The dominant privacy anti-pattern. Evaluate per processing activity — Contract (Art 6(1)(b)) covers most account / billing flows; Legitimate Interest (Art 6(1)(f)) covers most analytics; Consent is the basis for marketing email + tracking cookies only.
- **Sub-processor disclosure is exhaustive, not vague.** GDPR Art 28(2) requires controller's prior authorization for EACH sub-processor. "We use various third-party services" fails; "Stripe (payments), OpenAI (LLM features for issue summarization), Auth0 (authentication), Sentry (error monitoring), PostHog (product analytics), Resend (transactional email), Vercel + Neon (hosting + database)" passes.
- **DPIA trigger is binary, not aspirational.** When systematic monitoring OR sensitive data at scale OR automated decision-making OR large-scale profiling fires, DPIA is MANDATORY *before processing commences* (GDPR Art 35). NOT "we'll do a DPIA when we have time". Mark `[DPIA Required]` inline; flag in § Open Decisions if not yet completed; pause feature ship if blocked.
- **AI Act applicability begins August 2026.** Most B2B SaaS LLM features are *limited-risk* under Art 52 — transparency obligations only (user disclosure that AI is generating output). High-risk use cases (biometric, employment scoring, education scoring, law enforcement) jump to full conformity assessment — name them explicitly if relevant.
- **No meta-commentary section about the document's own legal discipline.** Do NOT write a `## Notes on this posture's compliance discipline` or any equivalent. The matrix tables + posture rows + open decisions ARE the discipline; a section *about* them is noise. (Inherits step-9 / 10 / 11 CUT-2.)
- **No "locked decisions" sub-section.** Product class, jurisdiction exposure, AI-stack signal are declared inline in § Overview opening. Re-tabling them as a separate Locked H2 duplicates the running commitment. (Inherits step-9 / 10 / 11 CUT-1.)
- **No metadata banner with pipe-separators at top of file.** Do NOT emit a header line in the shape `**Pipeline step:** 12 (Legal) | **Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Class:** B2B SaaS + AI-stack`. Ceremony with no payoff — file path + § Overview opening sentence carry the same signal. (Inherits step-11 CUT-3.)
- **The document is a posture briefing, NOT stapled drafts of ToS / Privacy / DPA / IP-analysis.** A founder hands this to outside counsel for a 30-minute conversation; the lawyer produces the actual artifacts. Sweet-spot file size is 11-14 KB for a standard B2B SaaS posture (expand to ~14 KB for B2B SaaS + AI-stack + Regulated Vertical overlap). A 30+ KB output is the regression mode where the agent slipped into drafting actual recitals / clauses / DPA terms — counsel-territory work that the escape clause at the TOP exists to prevent. Density discipline: prefer markdown tables, sub-bulleted lists, and one-line posture sentences over multi-paragraph narrative; the dense table substrate (regulation matrix + sub-processor table + OSS components + GDPR article-grid + Open Decisions + Risks) is the load-bearing shape.
- **Patent posture is explicit, not silent.** Default for software-only v1 stacks is no filings (Alice/Mayo § 101 risk). Hardware / biotech / true novel-method products carry distinct posture — those get a § Open Decisions row, not the default-skip line. Silence on patents is the CUT this rule fixes — counsel needs to see the posture even when the posture is "no filings".
- **PIIA + Founder IPAA are explicit § Open Decisions rows, not buried.** Two artifacts the founder MUST execute (Founder IPAA at entity formation; Contractor PIIA before first commit). Surfacing them as dedicated rows with deciding signals (NOT as a sub-paragraph under § Regulated Aspects § Trade-secret) is the discipline. Investors diligence IP chain of title at Series A — unassigned-contractor exposure is a deal-killer; deferring documentation past the trigger event is the regression mode.
- **Sub-processor jurisdiction = `architecture.json` sublabel OR cost-estimate § Run Cost source, NOT vendor HQ.** PostHog `"cloud, EU region"` (per architecture.json sublabel) is the correct cross-border posture; "UK" because Posthog Inc.'s HQ is in the UK is the regression. Regional deployment, not corporate domicile, drives the cross-border mechanism column.
- **Sub-processor count locks to cost-estimate § Run Cost vendor count.** 10-vendor cost-estimate → 10-row sub-processor table; 6-vendor → 6-row. Validator does NOT enforce; agent discipline catches mismatches as either Art 28(2) gaps (missing vendor) or ghost vendors (referenced without a cost line).
- **DSAR windows are per-regulation, not blanket.** GDPR Art 12: 30 days (extendable +60); LGPD Art 19: 15 days; CCPA / CPRA: 45 days (+45); PIPEDA: 30 days. Default to the strictest applicable window. Blanket "30-day SLA" under-serves LGPD subjects.
- **Open Decisions carry deciding signals.** Every deferred legal decision either HOLDS or FLIPS on a measurable signal — a first-EU-customer LOI, a counsel sign-off email, a regulatory-deadline date. Mirrors step-9 / 10 / 11 § Open Decisions discipline.
- **Exit / sub-criteria with ≥4 conditions format as sub-bulleted list, not single paragraph.** Inherits step-11's wall-of-text CUT. When § Regulated Aspects § HIPAA row carries 4+ posture conditions (covered-entity-status / BAA-required / encryption-standard / breach-notification-SLA / training-mandate), format as sub-bullets under the row, NOT a single paragraph.
- **Cross-references trace to source.** Privacy row cites `system-design § Data Model § PIIFields`; sub-processor row cites `system-design § Integrations § Stripe`; OSS-component row cites the actual `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `requirements.txt` path. Without source citations, the posture is decorative.

## What this step does NOT do

- **Draft actual ToS / Privacy Policy / DPA.** Those are lawyer artifacts produced after the founder briefs counsel using this document. The posture is the BRIEFING.
- **Tax / corporate-entity decisions.** Delaware C-Corp vs Cayman vs UK Ltd is a corporate-counsel decision distinct from product-legal posture. Different professional, different category.
- **Cap-table modeling, equity grants, board resolutions.** This step ports the *terms / privacy / IP* surface only. Corporate governance is a separate concern handled outside this pipeline.
- **Trademark clearance search execution.** The posture names the trademark concern + recommends the search; the actual search is a USPTO TESS / EUIPO eSearch + counsel review (or a paid clearance service).
- **Patent prosecution / FTO analysis.** Posture names the IP-assignment-from-contractors gap + the patentability vs FTO distinction; the actual analysis is a patent attorney's deliverable.
- **Employment-agreement drafting.** PIIA + offer letters + invention assignment for employees are corporate-counsel artifacts.
- **SOC 2 audit execution.** Posture names SOC 2 readiness timing + cost (step-10 § Run Cost); the actual audit is a 6-month observation window with a third-party auditor (Deloitte / Vanta-mediated / etc).
- **Live legal advice.** The founder reads this and books a 30-minute counsel call. The document does not substitute for the call.

## Design notes

This step unifies three legal disciplines into one synthesis posture document — corporate-counsel scope (terms of service, jurisdiction awareness, entity-type awareness), privacy-DPO scope (regulation matrix GDPR / LGPD / CCPA / PIPEDA / COPPA, controller-vs-processor framing, data-categories table with retention, sub-processor disclosure, DPIA trigger, 72-hour breach notification, matrix mode), and IP-counsel scope (OSS license compatibility matrix MIT / Apache 2.0 / LGPL / GPL / AGPL with SaaS implications, trade-secret protection, trademark clearance, patent FTO vs patentability, AGPL network-copyleft warning). The load-bearing disciplines (counsel-review checkpoint, regulation matrix shape, sub-processor exhaustiveness, AGPL warning, controller-vs-processor per-flow declaration) and their anti-patterns catalog are preserved intact.

Six calibration choices worth naming:

1. **Synthesis posture document, NOT corporate-document drafting.** This step produces a SYNTHESIS POSTURE document — a founder-facing inventory of "here's where v1 lands on each legal axis; outside counsel writes the actual artifacts" — NOT actual legal documents with WHEREAS / NOW-THEREFORE recitals, full DPAs with Article 28 clauses, or detailed claim-mapping IP analyses. Removes the "founder uses an AI-drafted board resolution unchecked" failure mode that ambitious legal-document templates structurally invite. The escape clause at the TOP makes the boundary explicit.

2. **Three-scope unification with conditional-section calibration.** ONE template with product-class-driven section emphasis: § Privacy fires loud for consumer + B2B SaaS; § Licensing fires loud for dev-tools + open-source; § Regulated Aspects fires only when triggers detect; § AI-Specific fires only when AI-in-stack signal is yes. The prior-artifact signals drive the routing. Closes the "one-mode template" audit-smell.

3. **Product-class calibration ladder.** Posture depth calibrates by product class — Micro 6 KB, Consumer Mobile 9 KB, B2B SaaS Full 9-11 KB, AI-stack 11-13 KB, Regulated Vertical 12-15 KB. Closes the "undynamic defaults" audit-smell. Classes overlap additively — a B2B SaaS + AI-stack + Healthcare regime expands to ~14 KB with 4 § Regulated Aspects rows.

4. **No magic-number floors.** Section coverage is driven by signal-extraction (jurisdiction exposure + AI-in-stack signal + product class), NOT magic minimums like "scope lists more than 5 requirements" or "at least 2 risks per phase". Every applicable regulation has a posture row, with NO minimum count — coverage is driven by trigger, not by floor.

5. **Sub-agent synthesis, NOT live interview.** `delegable: true` — fully delegable; the sub-agent reads prior artifacts and synthesizes the posture document with NO live parent interview. The 4 signals (product class / jurisdiction / sub-processor stack / AI-in-stack) are mechanically extracted from prior artifacts. Mirrors step-9 system-design's synthesis posture (in contrast to step-10 / step-11's `delegable: partial` with parent-only interview inputs). Closes the "single-orchestrator" audit-smell.

6. **§ Open Decisions with deciding signals + concern tags (mirrors step-9 / 10 / 11).** `## Open Decisions` carries decisions WITH a deciding signal that closes the deferral. Concern tags inherit the step-11 allow-list extended with `[counsel-review]` for legal-discipline rows.

The halt-protocol translates to the orchestrator's validation semantics: on failure, validation fails as `schema-incomplete`, listing exactly which file/section/check failed; nothing is written and the step does not advance. The 72-hour breach notification + DPIA trigger discipline + AGPL warning + controller-vs-processor framing are inherited intact — those are load-bearing.

### Calibration revisions applied (2026-05-16)

Six disciplines from blind judge feedback on the step-12 dogfood are absorbed as KEEPs; four anti-patterns are cut as CUTs. The KEEPs and CUTs unify — each CUT is fixed by one or more KEEPs (mirrors step-10 / step-11 commit-body convention):

1. **KEEP — Transitive-dependency-tree IP risk acknowledged** (fixes CUT 3: framework-level-only OSS inventory). The § Licensing § OSS component table treats framework-level inventory (Next.js, React, Prisma, …) as necessary but not sufficient — the actual `package-lock.json` / `Cargo.lock` reality is 600-1500 transitive deps; a single AGPL transitive is the dominant probabilistic risk. The transitive audit (via `license-checker` / `cargo-license` / `pip-licenses` / `go-licenses`) becomes a § Open Decisions row with deciding signal = end of polish phase / before public launch. Documented in § 4 step 5 (Licensing) + `references/oss-license-matrix.md` § Transitive-dependency posture.

2. **KEEP — PIIA + Founder IP Assignment Agreement as dedicated § Open Decisions rows** (fixes CUT 2: implicit PIIA workstream). The two IP-assignment artifacts (Founder IPAA at entity formation; Contractor PIIA before first commit) surface as explicit numbered § Open Decisions rows with concrete deciding signals and `[counsel-review] [founder]` concern tags, NOT buried under § Regulated Aspects § Trade-secret as a sub-paragraph. Documented in § 4 step 5 (Licensing) + § 4 step 8 (Open Decisions).

3. **KEEP — GDPR article-grid matrix as a reusable audit substrate.** When GDPR applies AND the product is non-trivial, the § Privacy Posture includes a sub-section table covering Articles 5/6/7/8/12/13/14/15-22/24/25/28/30/32/33/34/35/37/44-49 with `Applicable / Control / Evidence-location` columns. The fillable template lives in `references/privacy-matrix-shape.md` § GDPR article-grid; the agent populates with project-specific entries. Documented in § 4 step 3 (Privacy Posture).

4. **KEEP — DSAR-window-per-regulation precision.** GDPR Art 12: 30 days (extendable +60); LGPD Art 19: 15 days; CCPA / CPRA § 1798.130: 45 days (extendable +45); PIPEDA: 30 days. Default to the strictest applicable window when multiple regulations apply (typically LGPD's 15 days). Blanket "30-day SLA" is the regression mode — under-serves LGPD subjects. Documented in § 4 step 3 (Privacy Posture) + `references/privacy-matrix-shape.md` § DSAR-window-per-regulation.

5. **KEEP — Patent posture explicit negative** (fixes CUT 1: patent-posture silence). The § Licensing section now carries a default posture line for software-only v1 stacks: **no patent filings at pre-revenue stage due to Alice/Mayo § 101 prosecution risk; revisit at $5M ARR or when a true novel-method emerges.** Patent posture omission is the regression mode the line catches. Documented in § 4 step 5 (Licensing) + `references/oss-license-matrix.md` § Patent strategy.

6. **KEEP — Architecture.json sublabel-aware sub-processor jurisdiction precision** (fixes CUT 4: PostHog jurisdiction = "UK" by vendor HQ). § Data Handling § Sub-processor disclosure cross-border-mechanism column derives jurisdiction from `architecture.json` sub-component sublabel (e.g. PostHog `"cloud, EU region"`) OR cost-estimate § Run Cost source citation, NOT vendor HQ. Listing PostHog as "UK" because Posthog Inc.'s HQ is in the UK when the architecture.json declares EU-Cloud regionalization is the regression. Documented in § 4 step 4 (Data Handling).

Two meta-calibrations from the verdict's 200-word synthesis are also absorbed:

- **Consolidated tables (§ Open Decisions + § Risks) covering corporate + privacy + IP rows in ONE table each, NOT per-section sub-tables.** Documented in § 4 step 8 (Open Decisions). The earlier template already did this implicitly; the calibration makes the rule explicit and adds the § Risks parallel.
- **Sub-processor row-lock to cost-estimate § Run Cost vendor count** — a 10-vendor cost-estimate produces a 10-row sub-processor table. Validator does NOT enforce; the discipline is on the agent. Documented in § 4 step 4 (Data Handling).

Step-9 + step-10 + step-11 prior calibration anti-patterns are preserved unchanged: § Voice & rigor still carries "no meta-commentary section", "no Locked Decisions sub-section", "no metadata banner with pipe-separators at top of file", and "wall-of-text exit-criteria → sub-bulleted list when ≥4 conditions" (the CUTs from prior step calibrations).

# Step 10 — Cost Estimate

**Goal:** the one-page-ish financial model for v1 — build cost (one-time / first 3 months), run cost per month at v1 scale, unit economics if revenue-generating, scenario analysis (bear / base / bull), sensitivity (the 2-3 assumptions that drive 80% of variance), and the top 5 financial risks. The artifact step 11 (roadmap) reads to phase v1 spend and step 12 (legal) reads to size the compliance budget.

**Mode:** `draft-after-input` with `delegable: partial`. The parent must extract two pieces of input that no prior artifact pinned down — **pricing model** (free / freemium / one-time / subscription / usage-based / hybrid / not-for-profit) and **ballpark price point** (order of magnitude; $10/mo vs $100/mo vs $1k/mo — not exact). Once locked, the model derivation is mechanical from step-9 system-design + step-8 PRD inputs.

**Output file:** `cost-estimate.md` in `docs/`. Single-artifact — no `extra_files`.

**Projection notice (required).** `cost-estimate.md` MUST open — immediately after its H1 — with this blockquote (adapt the product reference, keep the bolded lead verbatim; it is a Layer 1 anchor):

> **Pre-validation projection.** These figures were derived before any of the product's assumptions (functional-spec § Assumption Register) were tested with real customers. Phase 1 costs are the only ones that merit planning confidence; everything else is order-of-magnitude. Re-derive this document once the riskiest assumptions have been tested.

---

## How to conduct this step

Read `references/cost-modeling-conventions.md` for the assumption-table shape (the load-bearing FPA discipline: every input has source + confidence), the scenario discipline (bear / base / bull NOT single-point estimates), the sensitivity heuristic (find the 2-3 assumptions that drive 80% of variance), and the product-class calibration ladder (compact micro-product → ~5 KB; SMB SaaS Full → ~10-15 KB).

### 1. Read everything prior

- **System design** — `docs/system-design.md` — § Stack drives infrastructure cost (managed Postgres vs self-hosted, Vercel vs Fly), § Integrations drives third-party cost (Stripe fees, OpenAI tokens, Auth0 vs Supabase), § Non-Functional § Scale Assumptions drives volume.
- **Architecture JSON** — `docs/data-flow.json` — quick scan of the components surface confirms the line-item count for run-cost.
- **Security** — `docs/security.md` — compliance posture (LGPD / GDPR / SOC 2) drives line items step 12 will expand (DPA cost, audit fees if SOC 2 pre-work).
- **PRD** — `docs/prd/v1.md` — § Goals drives the target price point (e.g. "<50% of competitor X" anchors the pricing-model conversation); § Success Metrics row 1 drives the scale-assumption to use; § User Stories drives build-cost surface; § Audit Response drives step-4 audit-driven cost items.
- **Cost-ceiling pointer** from step-9 system-design § Overview — the v1 infra cost ceiling target (e.g. `<$200/month at closed-beta scale`) is the anchor this step REFINES with concrete line items; do not silently revise it without naming why.

### 2. Parent collects pricing model + price point (2 questions, ~2 min)

The parent MUST conduct this exchange directly — not delegate. Two questions, sometimes a third:

1. **Pricing model.** *"Pricing model for v1 — free / freemium / one-time purchase / subscription / usage-based / hybrid / not-for-profit?"* If the PRD already named the model (it often does — competitive positioning in § Goals usually pins this), confirm rather than re-ask. Push back gently if the model conflicts with the PRD's audience (e.g. enterprise persona + free-only model = mismatch).

2. **Ballpark price point** *(skip if free / not-for-profit / internal):* *"Order of magnitude price target — $10/mo, $100/mo, $1k/mo, $10k/mo? Not exact; just the magnitude."* PRD § Goals usually names this too (e.g. "<$4/seat" anchors $1-10/user/mo magnitude). Confirm rather than re-ask when the PRD is clear.

3. **(Optional) Hourly rate placeholder** *(when build-cost needs anchoring):* *"Hourly rate for build-cost math? Default is $150/hr blended."* Skip when the founder already named a rate; default to $150/hr blended otherwise (a typical Bay-Area-ish dev rate; flag explicitly as a placeholder, mark `[Estimated]`).

### 3. Drafting delegates to a sub-agent

Once pricing + price point are locked, the parent dispatches an `Agent` sub-agent with the 5-field brief. CONTEXT includes:

- All prior artifact paths (step 8 PRD, step 9 system-design, step 9 architecture.json, step 9 security.md)
- The captured pricing model (verbatim)
- The captured ballpark price point (verbatim)
- The captured rate (or "default $150/hr")
- The step-9 cost-ceiling target sentence (verbatim)

The sub-agent's job is structural synthesis — fill the canonical cost-estimate template using the captured inputs + the prior-artifact reads. No more user questions; the parent's interview was the last input needing the founder.

Use `model: opus` for the sub-agent — sonnet sometimes drops the assumption-table discipline (source + confidence columns get omitted, which is the FPA regression mode the discipline catches).

### 4. The canonical cost-estimate structure

The sub-agent writes `cost-estimate.md` against this 7-required + 3-conditional spine (full shape with depth conventions lives in `references/cost-modeling-conventions.md`):

1. **Overview** — short paragraph PLUS two load-bearing one-liners (mirrors step-9 § Overview shape):
   - **Paragraph:** what's being modelled (v1 build + run), which scale assumption applies (from step-9 § Non-Functional), which pricing model + price point the founder locked. Names the product class (micro / mobile / dev-tool / SMB-SaaS / venture-scale) so depth calibration is visible.
   - **Biggest cost risk:** one sentence naming THE assumption most likely to break the model. Anti-pattern: even-keeled risk distribution. A SaaS with usage-based AI calls has ONE risk that dominates (token-cost-per-user); say it. Example: *"Biggest cost risk: Stripe fees + Postgres scaling are bounded; the wild card is paid-conversion rate — if conversion lands at 1% instead of 3% projected, run-cost-per-paying-user crosses break-even into negative."*
   - **v1 cost ceiling restate:** repeat the step-9 § Overview cost-ceiling target verbatim, then flag whether the line-item math supports or revises it. If revising upward, name why (which assumption changed). Example: *"v1 cost ceiling target was <$200/month closed-beta (per step 9 § Overview). Concrete line items below land at $178/month — within target."*

2. **Pricing Model** — declared model (free / freemium / one-time / subscription / usage-based / hybrid / not-for-profit) + one-paragraph rationale anchored to the PRD's persona + audience + § Goals. If subscription/freemium, name the tier structure here (free tier limits + paid tier features) — don't defer to a separate section. If usage-based, name the metering unit and the per-unit price. If free / not-for-profit, declare explicitly and note that § Unit Economics + § Scenarios + § Break-even will skip (or carry a degenerate "no revenue" form).

3. **Assumptions** — the load-bearing FPA assumption table. Every input the model depends on lands in this table with **value + source + confidence**. Format:
   ```markdown
   | # | Assumption | Value | Source | Confidence |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | 1 | Hourly rate (blended) | $150/hr | placeholder · founder · 2026-05-16 | Low (rate is illustrative) |
   | 2 | v1 build estimate | 14 weeks (10 weeks engineering + 4 weeks polish) | step 8 PRD § User Stories scope + step 9 system-design § Stack complexity | Medium |
   | 3 | Target scale (month-3) | 500 weekly-active teams | step 8 PRD § Success Metrics row 1 | High (founder-locked) |
   | 4 | Avg users per team | 5 | step 8 PRD § Target Users (5-30 person squads, conservative) | Medium |
   | 5 | Paid conversion (freemium) | 3% | benchmark · SaaS industry median 2-5% | Low (no product data yet) |
   ...
   ```
   Aim for 8-15 rows depending on product class. EVERY downstream number traces back to a row in this table — the assumption table IS the audit trail.

4. **Build Cost** — range estimate for v1 scope.
   - Format: `weeks × $/hr × hours-per-week = $-range`. Always a range, never a single point (the bear/base/bull scenario discipline applied to build-cost).
   - Breakdown by phase (Foundation / Killer flow / Surrounding features / Polish — mirroring step 11's roadmap shape).
   - Mark every number `[Estimated]` unless it traces to a vendor invoice or a signed contract.
   - Acknowledge the range. v1 build estimates are wrong by 30-50% routinely; bake it in.

5. **Run Cost** — per-month line items at v1 scale assumption. Format:
   ```markdown
   | Vendor | Tier | Monthly cost | Source |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Vercel | Pro | $20 | vendor pricing page · 2026-05-16 |
   | Supabase | Pro | $25 | vendor pricing page · 2026-05-16 |
   | Stripe | per-transaction | est $40 at v1 vol | 0.029 × 30 paid teams × $20 ARPU = $17.4; rounded with churn refunds | Medium |
   | Sentry | Team | $26 | vendor pricing page · 2026-05-16 |
   | Resend | Pro | $20 | vendor pricing page · 2026-05-16 |
   | Cloudflare R2 | per-GB | est $5 | usage projection | Low |
   | **Total** | | **$136/mo** | |
   ```
   Use current vendor pricing where available (mark `Source: vendor pricing page · YYYY-MM-DD`); mark scale-extrapolated numbers `[Estimated]` with confidence column. The total goes at the bottom of the table.

6. **Sensitivity** — the 2-3 assumptions that drive 80% of variance in the model. Per-assumption: name the assumption + the variance band + the model impact + the deciding signal that flips the design.
   - Format (single paragraph or short table — pick what scans best):
     ```markdown
     - **Paid conversion rate** (assumption 5 above): 3% projected, 1-5% plausible band. At 1%, run-cost-per-paying-user crosses break-even into negative ($136 / (500 × 0.01 × $20) = -$22/paying-team/mo); at 5%, gross margin clears 80% comfortably. **Deciding signal:** week-4 closed-beta paid conversion rate.
     - **Token-cost-per-user** (assumption 8 above): $0.20/mo placeholder, $0.05-$0.80 plausible band based on usage patterns. At $0.80, AI features turn from break-even helpers to loss leaders. **Deciding signal:** week-2 closed-beta AI-feature usage rate.
     - **Build-cost overrun** (assumption 2 above): 14 weeks projected, 14-22 weeks plausible. Each week over adds $6k at $150/hr × 40 hr/week. **Deciding signal:** end-of-Phase-2 milestone slip > 2 weeks.
     ```
   - This is the load-bearing FPA-discipline section. Treat it like step-9's `## Trade-off Triggers` — the 2-3 highest-stakes drivers that flip the recommendation. A cost-estimate without sensitivity is a single-point projection in disguise.

7. **Risks** — top 5 financial risks (NOT every financial risk; just the 5 most-likely-or-impactful). Per row: probability + financial impact + mitigation.
   ```markdown
   | # | Risk | Probability | Impact (1-month) | Mitigation |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | 1 | Stripe fees ramp faster than projected (high-volume small-ticket pattern) | Medium | +$50/mo at 100 paid teams | Switch to annual prepay; reduces fee % from 2.9% to 1.5% effective |
   | 2 | Postgres tier upgrade triggers (>500 weekly-active teams) | Medium | +$80/mo | Caps headroom at 5000 WAT; v1.1 carves out read-replica |
   | ... | | | | |
   ```

8. **Recommendations** — the load-bearing **decision** surface (3-5 founder/engineering actions, NOT a summary of sections above). Each recommendation is a verb-shaped call the founder makes Monday morning, with a deciding signal that would flip the recommendation. This section closes the artifact with decisions, not analysis. Format (one of two styles, pick the cleaner one for the product):
   ```markdown
   ## Recommendations

   1. **Hold per-seat price at $4/mo.** Pricing wedge is load-bearing for the PRD's competitive positioning; absorbing $50/mo Stripe-fee ramp via annual-prepay incentive (R1) preserves the wedge without re-pricing. *Flip if:* paid-conversion below 1% at week-4 of closed-beta forces revenue scrutiny.
   2. **Defer EU region + SOC 2 audit spend.** Both are 4-figure budget lines (DPA legal review ~$3k, SOC 2 Type 1 pre-audit ~$15k). v1 cost ceiling holds without them. *Flip if:* first 5 EU prospects in pipeline OR enterprise prospect requires SOC 2.
   3. **Pause public-launch acquisition spend until week-1 retention clears 40%.** PRD § Success Metrics row 1 names retention as the v1-worked signal; acquisition spend on a leaky bucket compounds CAC waste. *Flip if:* week-1 retention ≥ 40% in closed-beta for 2 consecutive weeks.
   4. **Reconcile bottom-up build estimate against top-down 6-month runway constraint pre-Phase-2.** Build-cost $84k-120k (range) sits inside $200k cash runway; sensitivity row 3 (week-overrun) is the watch — every 2 weeks over collapses runway headroom. *Flip if:* Phase-2 milestone slips > 2 weeks; rescope or extend.
   5. **Re-run this cost-estimate at week-6 of closed-beta** with measured paid-conversion + churn + Stripe-fee data. Pre-v1 numbers are placeholders; week-6 is the first point of real data.
   ```
   - 3-5 rows; pick the load-bearing decisions, not exhaustive coverage. The deciding signal ("Flip if:") is the discipline anchor — every recommendation either holds OR flips on a measurable signal.
   - Anti-pattern: "Recommendations: continue current approach" (no decision); "Recommendations: monitor metrics carefully" (no action). Both are sloppy and the section's job is to prevent them.
   - This section mirrors step-9's `## Trade-off Triggers (digest)` discipline — the 30-second-scan that a busy founder reads first. Treat the table above (§ 5 § Sensitivity) as the WHY and the recommendations as the WHAT.

**Conditional sections (revenue-generating products — skip for free / not-for-profit / internal):**

9. **Unit Economics** — CAC / LTV / LTV:CAC / payback period / gross margin / contribution margin. Format:
   ```markdown
   | Metric | Value | Calculation |
   |---|---|---|
   | ARPU | $20/mo | $4/seat × 5 users/team avg |
   | Gross margin | 78% | (ARPU − variable-run-cost-per-team) / ARPU = ($20 − $4.36) / $20 |
   | CAC | $80 | placeholder · founder estimate (sales-led, ~2 hrs founder time per close × $40/hr cost-basis) |
   | LTV (24mo churn-adj) | $360 | $20 × 24mo × 0.75 (NRR after 25% gross churn) |
   | LTV:CAC | 4.5:1 | $360 / $80 — healthy band is >3:1 |
   | Payback period | 4 months | $80 / ($20 × 0.78 gross margin × 1 paying team) |
   ```
   Skip when: free-only, not-for-profit, internal tool (no revenue → no unit economics; just say so).

10. **Projections** — month-by-month cadence for the **base** scenario (this is NOT the scenario variance table — that's § 11 next). 8-12 monthly rows from launch through year-1. Format:
    ```markdown
    | Period | Active workspaces | Paid workspaces | MRR | Infra cost | Total cost | Profit | Growth MoM |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Mo 1 (launch) | 50 | 0 (free trial) | $0 | $156 | $156 + amort. build | -$156 | — |
    | Mo 2 | 120 | 3 | $60 | $178 | $178 + amort. | -$118 | +140% workspaces |
    | Mo 3 | 250 | 8 | $160 | $200 | $200 + amort. | -$40 | +108% workspaces |
    | Mo 4 | 380 | 15 | $300 | $222 | $222 + amort. | +$78 | +52% workspaces |
    | Mo 5 | 500 | 24 | $480 | $245 | $245 + amort. | +$235 | +32% workspaces |
    | Mo 6 | 600 | 32 | $640 | $268 | $268 + amort. | +$372 | +20% workspaces |
    | ... | | | | | | | |
    ```
    - **Cadence:** monthly is the default; bi-weekly for very-early stage (first 2-3 months), quarterly for steadier products (year 2+). v1 cost estimate should land at monthly.
    - **The Projections section answers a different question than § Scenarios.** Scenarios answer "what's the variance band?" — Projections answer "what does the base-scenario monthly cash burn look like for runway planning?". A founder doing burn-rate math wants Projections; a founder doing fundraise prep wants Scenarios.
    - **Growth MoM column is honest, not extrapolated.** Early-stage growth percentages are typically very high (Mo 1 → Mo 2 commonly +100-200%) because the denominator is small. Don't smooth the curve; the curve IS the data.
    - Amortised build-cost column: divide the build-cost RANGE (§ 4 Build Cost) over a chosen period (commonly 12 or 24 months) and surface the per-month allocation. Mark `[Estimated]`. This is the load-bearing column for founder runway-math.
    - Skip when: free-only or not-for-profit (no MRR → projections degenerate to "monthly run cost only" — replace with a 6-row burn-only table in § Run Cost instead).

11. **Scenarios** — bear / base / bull (the FPA scenario discipline). Per scenario: probability weight + 1-3 key variable changes + impact on ARR + impact on runway / break-even.
   ```markdown
   | Scenario | Probability | New paid teams/mo | Churn | ARR EOY | Runway (assume $200k cash) |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Bear | 25% | 5 | 18% | $1.4k MRR EOY → $17k ARR | 9 mo |
   | Base | 50% | 15 | 12% | $4.2k MRR EOY → $50k ARR | 16 mo |
   | Bull | 25% | 30 | 8% | $9.1k MRR EOY → $109k ARR | 22 mo |
   ```
   - **Probability column is required** (not just decorative). Forces honest calibration vs hedging. The probabilities sum to 100%; common shapes are 25/50/25 (default for SMB SaaS), 30/40/30 (heavier tails for unproven wedge), 20/60/20 (tight base for proven category). Pick a shape that reflects how confident the founder actually is.
   - The probability values are themselves a Confidence-Low assumption. Mark them so in § Assumptions table; revise post-closed-beta when real data lands.
   - Skip when: free-only or not-for-profit (scenarios degenerate to cost-only — handle as a run-cost sensitivity range in § Sensitivity instead).

12. **Break-Even** — at what user count revenue covers run cost. State the assumption (paid conversion rate, ARPU) used.
    ```markdown
    Break-even: 9 paid teams ($136 run-cost / ($20 ARPU × 78% gross margin) = 8.7 → 9 teams).
    At 3% paid conversion: 300 weekly-active teams produces 9 paid teams → break-even at 60% of v1 target scale.
    ```
    Skip when: free-only or not-for-profit (no break-even concept — frame as "monthly burn at v1 scale" instead, which is just § Run Cost total).

### 5. Calibrate by product class (smart, not rigid)

Mirrors step-9's product-class calibration ladder:

| Product class | cost-estimate.md depth | Sections to keep / adapt |
|---|---|---|
| **Micro-Product / CLI helper / single-purpose tool** | Compact (~7 KB) | Full structure but Build-Cost is 1-2 weeks, Run-Cost is 1-3 line items, Projections may collapse to 4-6 rows, Scenarios may degenerate to bear/base only |
| **Mobile App** | Standard (~10 KB) | Full structure; § Run Cost adds app-store revenue-share line (15-30% Apple/Google cut); § Scenarios accounts for review-cycle delay impact on launch; § Projections handles app-store gating delays in early months |
| **Developer Tool / API-first** | Standard-Expanded (~12 KB) | Full structure; § Pricing Model often usage-based (per-API-call / per-seat-with-API-rate-limits); § Unit Economics emphasises token cost / per-call infra cost; § Projections per-call-volume tracking |
| **SMB SaaS (the default)** | Full (~13-18 KB) | Full structure; § Pricing Model typically per-seat subscription; § Scenarios carry 3 paid-conversion bands; § Projections 8-12 monthly rows through year-1 |
| **Venture-Scale / Marketplace / multi-persona** | Expanded (~18-25 KB) | Full structure; § Unit Economics expanded to per-persona ARPU/CAC; § Scenarios add upside/downside on take-rate (marketplaces) or per-persona conversion (multi-persona); § Projections may need cohort overlay or per-persona breakdown |

Brief field missing or ambiguous → default to **SMB SaaS (Full)**. Mark the chosen depth in `## Overview` opening sentence (`v1 cost estimate for an SMB SaaS — full template depth applied.`).

For free / not-for-profit / internal tools: full structure minus § Unit Economics + § Scenarios + § Projections + § Break-Even (which degenerate); document the skip in `## Pricing Model` (`Pricing model: not-for-profit / internal — § Unit Economics, § Scenarios, § Projections, § Break-Even intentionally absent.`). Free/NFP products still keep § Recommendations — even non-revenue products have founder/eng decisions to make (vendor lock-in posture, scaling triggers, audit budget).

### 6. Submit + advance

Write `cost-estimate.md` (the full cost estimate) to `docs/` — but ONLY after the step's Layer-1 validation passes; write the artifact atomically (mktemp + rename) so it lands whole or not at all. Single-artifact step — no companion files.

Schema enforces section presence + Layer 1 contains/size floors (assumption-table header, run-cost vendor-table header, total-line literal). On success, advance `.state.json` to step 11 (roadmap — reads PRD + system-design + cost-estimate to sequence v1 build).

**No gate at step 10.** Step 12 (legal-posture) closes the Specification phase gate. Steps 8 → 12 advance fluidly through Specification.

---

## Voice & rigor

- **Mark every number `[Estimated]` that isn't a current vendor invoice / signed contract / pricing-page snapshot with date.** Vendor pricing pages are factual (`Source: vendor pricing page · 2026-05-16`); user-count projections are estimates; build-cost is the most-likely-wrong number, always a range never a point.
- **Ranges everywhere, not just build cost.** Every monetary or effort figure that is `[Estimated]` presents as a range ("$ 35-60k", "8-12 weeks") — a point value on an estimate fakes precision the model does not have. Point values are reserved for sourced facts (vendor list prices, signed contracts). Derived totals propagate the range arithmetic (sum the lows, sum the highs).
- **Order of magnitude is what matters.** `$2k/mo at 1000 users` is useful; `$2,143/mo at 1000 users` is false precision — three significant figures is the upper limit at v1 (you don't know enough to claim more).
- **If unit economics don't work (run-cost-per-user > price × gross margin), surface loudly.** Don't bury in § Sensitivity. The PRD's pricing target may be wrong; the founder needs to see this.
- **The assumption table IS the audit trail.** Every number downstream cites a row in § Assumptions. No room for floating numbers.
- **Bear / base / bull are not optional for revenue products.** Single-point projections are the regression mode. Skip ONLY for free / not-for-profit (where they degenerate).
- **Build-cost overruns are systemic.** Every project goes over. Bake 30% buffer into the range high-end; the buffer isn't pessimism, it's calibration.
- **Sensitivity + Recommendations are the load-bearing scans.** A reader who has 30 seconds reads § Overview + § Sensitivity (the WHY) + § Recommendations (the WHAT). § Sensitivity names the 2-3 assumptions that drive the variance; § Recommendations names the 3-5 actions to take Monday morning. Both work standalone.
- **§ Projections answers monthly burn math; § Scenarios answers variance bands.** Different questions, different consumers (founder doing runway math vs founder doing fundraise prep). Don't conflate them. Projections is the base-scenario monthly cadence; Scenarios is the bear/base/bull variance.
- **§ Scenarios carries probability weights (25%/50%/25% or similar).** Sums to 100%. Forces honest calibration vs hedging. Mark the probabilities themselves as Confidence-Low in § Assumptions; revise post-closed-beta when real data lands.
- **§ Recommendations are DECISIONS, not summaries.** Verb-shaped ("Hold per-seat price", "Defer EU spend", "Pause acquisition until retention clears"). Each carries a deciding signal that flips it. Anti-pattern: "Continue current approach" / "Monitor metrics carefully" — both are non-decisions; the section's job is to prevent them.
- **PRD `US-NN` cross-references where useful.** § Build Cost may scope per-user-story (e.g. "US-07 keyboard-first triage: 3 weeks; US-19 bulk-action: 1 week"); § Run Cost may scope per-integration (e.g. "Stripe drives US-25 + US-28; Resend drives US-23"). Not mandatory at the row level — but useful when the trace is non-obvious.
- **No meta-commentary about the document's own discipline.** Do NOT write a `## Notes on this cost model's assumption traceability` H2 or any equivalent. The assumption table + the Source columns + the `[Estimated]` flags ARE the discipline; a section *about* them is noise. Judge-feedback (2026-05-16) flagged this anti-pattern across the pipeline; the rule applies here pre-emptively.
- **No "locked decisions" sub-section.** Pricing model, price point, and rate-placeholder are locked in the running prose of § Pricing Model + § Assumptions table. Re-tabling them as a separate Locked H2 duplicates the running commitment. Carries the step-9 calibration discipline.

## What this step does NOT do

- **Detailed financial planning.** This is a one-page-ish artifact for the product spec, not a CFO model. 10-15 KB is the full-template upper bound for SMB SaaS; if it grows past 25 KB, the agent is over-prescribing.
- **Pricing decisions.** Pricing tier values are an estimate / starting point; real pricing comes from market test post-launch. The founder's locked ballpark is the anchor.
- **Fundraising deck inputs.** Step 17 GTM (a future pipeline step) absorbs that work.
- **Capacity planning under viral growth.** v1 scale assumption only; viral-growth modeling is post-v1 cost-revision work.
- **Detailed forecast accuracy backtesting.** This is a one-shot model; revision happens in subsequent product cycles.
- **Roadmap phasing.** Step 11 reads this artifact to phase v1 build by cost-pressure; build-cost ranges land here, sequencing lands there.
- **Compliance budget.** Step 12 (legal-posture) absorbs DPA cost, audit fees if SOC 2, sub-processor budget. § Run Cost may flag "compliance line items deferred to step 12" with a pointer.

## Design notes

This step keeps the load-bearing FPA discipline (documented assumption table with source + confidence; bear / base / bull scenarios; sensitivity for the 2-3 drivers of 80% variance; top-5 financial risks register; unit economics for revenue products) and the canonical anti-patterns catalog (undocumented assumptions, single-point estimates, no sensitivity).

Three calibration choices worth naming:

1. **Operational-metrics / process-mapping / efficiency-analysis are out of scope.** That's ops-monitoring territory, not product-spec cost modeling. If a future pipeline step models operational efficiency (capacity planning, headcount-to-revenue ratio, process throughput), it lands there, not in this step. FPA wins for cost-estimate.

2. **No consumer-level budget config file.** The budget inputs come from the parent's § 2 interview (pricing model + price point + rate) at synthesis time, not from a config file. This pipeline doesn't model consumer-level financial state.

3. **Cost-ceiling cross-reference to step 9.** § Overview restates the step-9 cost ceiling and flags whether line-item math supports or revises it — closes the cross-step loop. The step-to-step contract symmetry (step-9 declares the ceiling, step-10 refines it with concrete line items) was added in the post-task-18 calibration.

Resumability is `.state.json`; the halt protocol is the `schema-incomplete` validation error.

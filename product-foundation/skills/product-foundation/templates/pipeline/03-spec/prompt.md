# Step 3 — Spec

**Goal:** a multi-artifact specification bundle that pins down what the product DOES — every page, every component, every interaction, every state, decomposed into features with Gherkin acceptance scenarios — plus a preliminary architecture shape derived from it. The functional spec is the behavioral contract a developer reads to build; the architecture artifacts are the structural skeleton step 9 (system-design) deepens. Pure synthesis from steps 1+2 — sub-agent territory.

**Mode:** `synthesis`. Fully delegable. The parent assembles the step's 5-field delegation brief and dispatches an `Agent` sub-agent with it. The sub-agent reads `docs/` + `docs/` and produces the bundle without further user input. There is no user checkpoint — step 3 is mid-Discovery, no gate.

**Output bundle** (all written atomically as one bundle — a primary plus companion files):

| File | Role | Floor |
|---|---|---|
| `functional-spec.md` | behavioral contract — pages, components, interactions, states, features, acceptance scenarios | ≥ 15 KB |
| `architecture.md` | structural shape — module decomposition, data model, key flows, integration points | ≥ 4 KB |
| `architecture.html` **or** `architecture.json` | the same architecture as a rendered diagram (mermaid / inline SVG) **or** a machine-readable graph | one of the two |

The architecture artifacts are **derived from `functional-spec.md`** — write the functional spec first, then read it back and extract the structure. This derivation chain is what keeps the three files in sync; see `references/architecture-shape.md`.

---

## How to conduct this step

Read `references/functional-spec-template.md` (the full output shape for `functional-spec.md`) and `references/anti-patterns.md` before drafting. Read `references/examples.md` for good/bad table shapes. Read `references/architecture-shape.md` before deriving the architecture artifacts. Run `references/checklist.md` before submitting.

### 1. Read prior artifacts

- **Concept brief (step 1)** — the *why*. Internalize the JTBD, the target persona(s), the killer flow named in the user-flow section, the anti-goals. The spec must not drift outside the concept's scope.
- **Prototype (step 2)** — the *what surfaces exist*. The 3 HTML directions + the chosen direction's hi-fi screens are the ground truth for which pages and components the product has. The spec decomposes what step 2 rendered; it does not invent new surfaces.

If a prior artifact is missing or thin, say so to the parent and stop — do not fabricate the missing input.

### 2. Identify pages & surfaces

List every distinct page/screen/surface the user sees — including the ones easy to forget: landing/marketing, auth (login, signup, forgot-password), settings/profile, admin/backoffice, empty-first-run. For each, write **name**, **purpose** (one sentence), **entry points** (how the user gets here), and a small **ASCII wireframe** sketch. Then, per page:

- **Components table** — `| Component | Type | Description |`. Type is one of `navigation`, `data-display`, `action`, `input`, `feedback`, `modal`, `form`, `media`. List every interactive element, even "obvious" ones (nav links, the back button).
- **Interactions table** — `| Component | Trigger | Action | Result |`. One row per interactive component. Trigger/action/result must all be concrete — "click → opens modal → new-project form appears", never "user can manage projects".
- **States table** — `| State | Condition | What the user sees |`. Every page needs at minimum empty / loading / error / populated; add filtered-empty, permission-denied, offline where they apply.

**Scale depth to surface importance.** Killer-flow surfaces and any page central to the persona's daily use get the full treatment — purpose, entry points, wireframe, and all three tables filled exhaustively. Trivial surfaces (a Skip-button-flanked onboarding micro-page, a single-form settings sub-page, an info-only confirmation page) get a compact treatment: one-line purpose + entry points, the wireframe may be omitted, and **the three tables stay (same Components / Interactions / States headers) but each collapses to ~2–4 rows** covering only the surface's actual interactive elements. Do not collapse the three tables into a single combined block — the parallel skeleton is what lets a reader scan across pages. Covering trivial pages at the same depth as the killer flow produces a spec that is exhaustive on paper and unreadable in practice. The schema enforces *presence* of the section (every page appears with at least the three table headers and the states floor), not *parity of depth* across pages. When in doubt, give the surface the full treatment; the floor exists to catch genuine omissions, not to punish appropriate brevity.

### 3. Decompose into features

Each page surfaces 1–N features. A feature is "user can do X in context Y producing outcome Z". Be exhaustive *within the prototype's complexity budget* — don't invent features outside what steps 1+2 established. Per feature capture:

- **what it does** (one sentence)
- **happy-path behavior** (user actions + system responses, in sequence)
- **edge cases** (the ones that actually apply — empty, validation failure, network failure, race, permission denial, large input — not a generic list)
- **success criterion** (observable evidence it works; this feeds step 4 testing and step 8 PRD acceptance criteria)
- **anti-goals** — 1–3 bullets stating *what this feature must NOT become*. Different from the spec-level `## Non-Goals` block (which excludes whole features); these guard against scope creep *inside* the feature once it ships. Examples that catch real failure modes: "NOT a bulk-edit surface — bulk lives in Backlog" (keeps the killer flow per-issue), "NOT a mouse-friendly version of the same flow — keyboard primary, mouse secondary" (preserves the persona's core promise), "NOT a search interface — list-and-filter only, full search is a separate feature". Without these, a single feature drifts toward category-killer over a few iterations and the original sharpness is lost.
- **architecture seed** — 1–3 sentences naming the *module placement* + *key entities involved* + *integration touchpoints*. Module names only (e.g. "lives in `triage/` module, reads from `Issue` + `User`, fires the `issue-updated` event"); **no SQL DDL, no API endpoint shapes, no background-job specs** — those are step 9 (system-design) deliverables. The seed exists so an engineer reading step 3 has a non-zero pointer to where the work lands; step 9 takes the seed and deepens it (schema, contracts, scale, deployment).

### 4. Write acceptance scenarios (Gherkin)

For every feature with 3+ behavior branches, write 2–4 `Given` / `When` / `Then` scenarios — at minimum one happy path, one error path, one edge case. Each `Then` clause must be **assertion-shaped**: specific values, visible text, files, status — never "works correctly" or "is fast". These scenarios are the source spec for tests during implementation and map 1:1 to step 8 (PRD) acceptance criteria. Bold the keywords (`**Given**`, `**When**`, `**Then**`) so the section is machine-greppable.

### 5. Cross-cutting concerns

One paragraph each, only for the ones that apply: auth model (anonymous? login? roles/RBAC?), data persistence (local? remote? sync semantics? offline?), accessibility (screen-reader, keyboard nav), i18n. Stay shallow — this is the *shape* of the concern, not its system design. Deep treatment is step 9.

### 6. Navigation map + Decisions Pending

Draw an ASCII navigation diagram covering every page transition and its trigger. Then close `functional-spec.md` with a `## Decisions Pending` table — `| # | Question | Impact | Default if unresolved |` — capturing every unresolved choice (two reasonable alternatives, a scope-boundary call not explicitly confirmed, an IA decision affecting multiple pages). If there are genuinely none, write the explicit empty-state line. **Target ~5–10 rows for a non-trivial product**; if synthesis legitimately surfaces more, group them into a `### v1-blocking` and a `### deferred-to-post-v1` sub-section so step 8 (PRD) sees the priority split. A row count drifting much above 10 without that split usually means trivial choices are being elevated to "decisions" — fold them into the prose of the page they affect. This table is the handoff contract step 8 (PRD) consumes — each row becomes a resolved requirement with a `from spec decision #N` back-reference.

### 7. Derive `architecture.md`

Read `functional-spec.md` back and extract the structural skeleton — see `references/architecture-shape.md` for the full shape. Sections: **Module Decomposition** (frontend pages/components → backend modules/services; new vs. extend), **Data Model** (entities + relationships + key fields, informal — no SQL DDL, no migration syntax; that's step 9), **Key Flows** (the killer flow traced through the modules, as numbered steps or a sequence sketch), **Integration Points** (external systems named, what is called, fallback posture). End with **Open Architecture Questions** — anything genuinely deferred to step 9 (scale, deployment topology, stack-specific choices).

### 8. Derive `architecture.html` OR `architecture.json`

Pick one (the agent's call — `references/architecture-shape.md` covers both):

- **`architecture.html`** — a single self-contained HTML file rendering the architecture as a diagram: a mermaid `graph`/`flowchart` block in a `<script type="module">` mermaid bootstrap, or an inline `<svg>`. Module nodes + data-model entities + flow edges. Human-readable at a glance.
- **`architecture.json`** — a machine-readable graph: `{ "modules": [...], "entities": [...], "flows": [...], "integrations": [...] }`. Consumable by tooling.

Whichever you choose, it must be *derivable from* `architecture.md` — same modules, same entities, same flows. Mismatch between the two is a failure.

### 9. Submit + advance

Write the bundle to `docs/` — `functional-spec.md` (the full functional spec) plus `architecture.md` and `architecture.html` (or `architecture.json`) — but ONLY after the step's Layer-1 validation passes; write the bundle atomically (mktemp + rename) so it lands whole or not at all. Layer 1 validates all three atomically — nothing is written unless every file passes. On `schema-incomplete`, the failure list names exactly which file failed which check (missing path / undersized / missing substring); fix and rewrite.

After a clean write, advance `.state.json` — step 3 is mid-Discovery, no gate, advances to step 4 (validation). No human checkpoint: the synthesis is auditable in the artifacts themselves.

---

## Voice & rigor

- **Reader-oriented.** A developer building from `functional-spec.md` should never have to ask "what happens when X?". If they would, document X.
- **Product language in the functional spec; structural language in the architecture.** `functional-spec.md` describes behavior a non-technical stakeholder can follow — "saves your changes", "updates in real-time", not "POSTs to the API". `architecture.md` is where module names, entities, and integration points appear. Keep the two registers separate.
- **Don't pre-decide the stack.** "Persist state to the user's account" is a spec; "use Postgres with Prisma" is step-9 system-design. `architecture.md` names *modules and entities*, not *technologies and versions*.
- **Acceptance scenarios are assertion-shaped.** A `Then` a verifier can't check is not done.
- **Length budget.** `functional-spec.md` lands ≥ 15 KB for a non-trivial product (the deep-port floor — a thinner spec is almost certainly missing pages, states, or features). If you genuinely can't fill 15 KB, the prototype scope was probably too small for this pipeline — flag back to the parent rather than padding.
- **Three files, one truth.** `architecture.md` and `architecture.{html,json}` are *derived* — if they disagree with `functional-spec.md` or each other, that's a defect, not a variation.

## Assumption Register (extends Discovery phase)

The functional-spec MUST include an `## Assumption Register` H2 section. **This replaces the former Problem-Validation Interviews section — never write interview summaries that did not happen.** A fabricated interview reads as evidence; an assumption register reads as what it is: the bets this product rests on, stated so the founder can test them. Shape:

1. **The bets table** — 5-10 rows, each one assumption that must be TRUE for the product to succeed:

```markdown
| # | Assumption (must be true) | Risk type | Confidence | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Salon owners lose recurring clients to scheduling chaos | value | medium | 14 Reddit/community threads [3][7]; no primary data |
| A2 | Owners will trust an app with their client book | viability | low | inferred from persona; zero direct signal |
```

- **Risk type** — one of `value` (do they want it?), `usability` (can they use it?), `viability` (does the business work?), `feasibility` (can we build it?). Every register needs at least one `value` and one `viability` row — those are the two an LLM cannot resolve from a desk.
- **Confidence** — `high` (multiple independent cited sources) / `medium` (secondary signal, no primary) / `low` (pure inference from the persona). Real founder-supplied evidence (actual customer conversations fed into the run) is the only thing that justifies `high` on a `value` row — cite it explicitly when present.
- **Basis** — where the confidence comes from: citations, persona inference, founder input. Never blank.

2. **`### Riskiest assumption`** — name the ONE row that kills the product if false, and why it beats the others.

3. **`### Cheapest real-world test`** — a concrete recipe the founder can run before (or while) building: who to talk to, how many, what to ask or show, what it costs in days. This is written advice — the orchestrator never checks or enforces it; the pipeline proceeds regardless.

4. **`### Abandon signal`** — one falsifiable threshold that should trigger a rethink, e.g. "if fewer than 3 of 10 salon owners recognize the problem unprompted, stop or reframe". Advisory by design: it arms the founder's judgment, it does not gate the pipeline.

**Why this matters:** Step 06 OST consumes the register's `value` rows as opportunity inputs, carrying each row's confidence tag — so the tree distinguishes opportunities backed by real signal from inferred ones instead of laundering inference into fact. Downstream projection documents (roadmap, cost, GTM) inherit the register's uncertainty posture.

## What this step does NOT do

- **Full system design** — scale assumptions, deployment topology, security/threat-model, stack-specific decisions. That's step 8. `architecture.md` here is the *preliminary* skeleton step 8 deepens; the `## Open Architecture Questions` section is the explicit handoff.
- **Visual / brand decisions** — step 13 (brand), step 14 (design-system) — moved AFTER Specification per PRD-first ordering.
- **Pricing, business model details** — step 5 (PRD 1-pager) + step 11 (cost-estimate) + step 12 (gtm-launch).
- **Test execution** — step 4 (validation). But the success criteria and acceptance scenarios written here ARE the inputs to step 4's tests.
- **Sitemap / full screen inventory** — step 7 (sitemap-IA). This step's § Pages & Surfaces is a sketch; Step 7 is the canonical inventory.
- **Comprehensive screen atlas** — step 15 (screen-atlas).

## Design notes

This template synthesises two disciplines into one three-artifact bundle:

- **Visual-spec discipline** — pages → components → interactions → states → navigation map, plus the `## Decisions Pending` handoff table. The stakeholder-readable rigor lives in `functional-spec.md`, supplemented by the feature decomposition.
- **Per-feature depth** — problem framing, scope boundaries, the architecture section (module placement, data model, integration points), and Gherkin acceptance scenarios. The discovery interview rounds collapse into reading the concept brief (discovery already happened in step 1 ideation), so step 3 is pure synthesis.

Resumability is `.state.json`; the halt protocol is the `schema-incomplete` validation error; the three-artifact bundle persists atomically through `extra_files`.

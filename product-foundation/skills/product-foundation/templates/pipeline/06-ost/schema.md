# Step 06 — OST schema

## Output file

`<out>/docs/ost.md`

## Size floor (anti-stub)

The size **ceiling** is retired — artifact scope is judged by the quality judge (`references/quality-judge.md`), not a byte count. Only the `min_size` **floor** remains.

| Artifact | `min_size` floor | Floor rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `ost.md` | 3 KB | below this the tree is too thin or solutions too shallow |

A uniform 200 KB catastrophe cap applies.

## Required structure

```markdown
# OST — <product name>

_OST shape per Teresa Torres, Continuous Discovery Habits (Product Talk Academy)._

## Desired Outcome

> <verbatim quote of PRD's NSM>

## Opportunities

(3-5 entries, each with provenance tag + 2-3 solutions each with status tag)
```

## Required attributes per node

| Node type | Required attributes |
|---|---|
| Desired Outcome | verbatim NSM quote (1 root only) |
| Opportunity | user-voice problem statement + provenance tag `[interview: <subject>]` OR `[inferred: <persona>]` |
| Solution | high-level approach (NOT implementation) + status tag `explored` / `to-test` / `parked` |

## Format choices

- **Nested markdown bullets** (default) — fastest write, easiest diff
- **Mermaid diagram** — when tree breadth ≥4 AND breadth/depth ratio favors visual

Sub-agent picks based on clarity at actual tree depth.

## Validation rules (parent-side, post-Step-06 return)

1. Exactly 1 Desired Outcome (single root)
2. 3-5 Opportunities (refuse if fewer than 3 OR more than 5)
3. 2-3 Solutions per Opportunity (refuse if 0 OR >3)
4. Every Opportunity has provenance tag
5. Every Solution has status tag
6. File size ≥ 3 KB (anti-stub floor — no ceiling; scope is the quality judge's call)

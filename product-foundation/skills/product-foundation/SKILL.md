# /product-foundation — 15-step foundation generator + design partner

Takes a founder's one-line idea and produces a complete v1-ready product foundation at `<--out>`: concept brief (with binding § Product Form declaration + market sizing as explicit hypothesis) → **concept gate** (the cheapest kill/redirect point) → lo-fi prototype (mood + killer flow, form-adapted) → functional spec (with the § Assumption Register — the bets this product rests on; never fabricated interviews) → UX audit → PRD 1-pager → OST (Opportunity Solution Tree) → sitemap-IA (full inventory with form-conditional required_categories enforcement) → system design (with RACI + risk + data-flow inventory) → legal posture (DPIA-triggered by data-flow, NOT end-of-pipeline) → roadmap (defines phases; opens with the pre-validation projection notice) → cost estimate (per-phase using roadmap; projection notice + ranges) → GTM-launch (projection notice) → brand book → design system → **visual contract** (navigable screen-atlas + hi-fi killer-flow mood + fixture-spec — form-adapted per `references/product-forms.md`) → **mandatory SDD handoff** (scaffolds the umbrella + foundation child spec the engineering build runs as). 5 phases with 4 condensed user gates (concept + 3 phase gates with distilled review agendas). **`/product-foundation` produces a docs-first foundation, NOT a runnable app** — semantic naming (no NN- prefix), PRD release-scoped at `docs/prd/v1.md`, design system grouped at `docs/design-system/`. The app build is the SDD workflow working the scaffolded specs. Founder reads `docs/REPORT.html` — a navigable, rendered reading surface regenerated at every gate — or `docs/REPORT.md` for the plain temporal narrative; the structure supports v2/v3/vN evolution without manual reorg.

**Design posture (load-bearing):** Step 03 uses an **assumption register** (the bets table + riskiest assumption + cheapest real-world test + abandon signal — written advice, nothing gates), and Step 01 market sizing is framed as an explicit hypothesis — never fabricated interviews. The **quality judge** runs once per phase (4 calls per run) on a provisional sonnet/opus phase mix. A **concept gate** fires after Step 01 (continue/adjust/abort) and each phase gate presents a **distilled review agenda** (the 3-5 decisions worth the founder's eye). Steps 10-12 open with a `**Pre-validation projection.**` notice and present cost as ranges. **Product-form awareness** — Step 01 declares `screen-app | headless-service | cli | bot | embedded` (mirrored to `.state.json.product_form`); Steps 02/07/14/15 adapt per `references/product-forms.md`. A post-run **staleness checker** (`scripts/staleness-check.ts`) names downstream artifacts gone stale after upstream hand-edits. The pipeline ships NO stack code — Phase 5 hands off a stack-aware SDD umbrella + a research-driven foundation child. The visual-contract phase ends at `screen-atlas.md` + a hi-fi killer-flow mood (static HTML) + `fixture-spec.md`, then mandatorily hands off to SDD. Nothing new blocks: the founder can always proceed; the documents just confess what they are.

**Path resolution — read this before any `bash`/`bun`/`Read` call below.** Every bundled path in this SKILL.md
and in `templates/**` is written against **`<this-skill-dir>`** — the directory this SKILL.md was loaded from.
Your runtime tells you where it materialized it (Claude prints it as *Base directory for this skill*). Resolve it
once, to an **absolute** path, and use that. `<sdd-skill-dir>` is the `sdd` skill's own directory, resolved the
same way. Two rules that follow:

- **Never** hardcode `.claude/skills/…`, `.agents/skills/…` or `.tachyon/plugins/…`. An agent running in its own
  git worktree has none of those directories, and the skill tree is delivered into the agent's private runtime
  home — not into the workspace.
- When you dispatch a sub-agent, **substitute the resolved absolute path** for every `<this-skill-dir>` /
  `<sdd-skill-dir>` occurrence in the brief you send. A sub-agent does not load this skill and cannot resolve
  the placeholder itself.

**Required reading before execution:**
- `references/pipeline-coverage.md` — what each of the 15 steps produces at standard tier
- `references/state-machine.md` — `.state.json` v6 shape + 5-phase progression + resume support (breaking: refuses silent v5 → v6 upgrade)
- `references/delegation-briefs.md` — 5-field briefs for every sub-agent dispatch (one per pipeline step; Step 15 = 15a-atlas / 15b-hi-fi-mood / 15c-fixture-spec; the shared mood-screen-writer template)
- `references/sdd-handoff.md` — the Phase 5 contract: how to scaffold the umbrella spec + foundation child from the pipeline artifacts
- `references/quality-judge.md` — the quality judge: when it runs, rubric assembly, the verdict shape, the verdict→gate routing
- `references/quality-checklist.md` — the quality judge's semantic rubric (per-step + visual-contract criteria) + the deterministic orchestrator gates
- `references/sitemap-schema.md` — `required_categories` enforcement + per-route field set (load-bearing — orchestrator BLOCKS Step 07 if uncovered category found without `deferred_categories` declaration)
- `references/product-forms.md` — the form-factor taxonomy (`screen-app | headless-service | cli | bot | embedded`) + the four per-form variant surfaces (Step 02 mood, Step 07 category set, Step 14 scope, Phase 4 contract)

## Argument parsing

User invokes as `/product-foundation "<idea>" --out=<path> [flags]`. The raw argument string is `$ARGUMENTS`. Parse it yourself:

1. First quoted-token is `<idea>` — refuse with `usage: /product-foundation "<idea>" --out=<path> [flags]` if missing.
2. `--out=<path>` is REQUIRED — refuse if missing. Resolve to absolute path.
3. Optional flags (any order after idea): `--stack=<name>` (next | expo; default: web stack inferred from idea → next), `--from-step=NN` (resume from step N in range 1-15), `--skip-prd` (omit Step 05 dispatch — degenerate; PRD feeds Steps 06-15), `--skip-brand` (omit Step 13 + fall back to `templates/default-tokens.css`).
4. Compute `slug` = kebab-case from idea (lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens, max 40 chars).

## Phase 0 — Setup + idempotency check + resume detection — 🔒 Low freedom: deterministic file scan + harness filter

1. **Idempotency check** — list files at `<out>`. Filter out the **runtime/harness allowlist** (these are exempt; a project that carries only its runtime harness is "fresh" from `/product-foundation`'s perspective):

   ```
   .claude/   .agents/   .tachyon/   .githooks/
   .gitignore   CLAUDE.md   AGENTS.md   .git/
   ```

   Compute `<remaining>` = files at `<out>` MINUS the harness allowlist above (recursive — `.claude/**`, `.agents/**`, `.tachyon/**`, `.git/**` all count as harness).

   - **If `<remaining>` is empty** (or `<out>` doesn't exist): proceed to step 2 (Init) — no prompt, no rm, harness preserved. This is the natural path for a project that carries only its runtime harness (harness-disciplined from day one).
   - **If `<remaining>` is non-empty:**
     - If `--from-step=NN` was passed AND `<out>/docs/.state.json` exists: read state, validate (a) `version == 6` — if v5 found, abort with `state v5 found — older /product-foundation run; clear --out dir or run fresh /product-foundation`; if v4 found, abort with `state v4 found — older /product-foundation run; clear --out dir or run fresh /product-foundation`; if v3 found, abort with `state v3 found — older /product-foundation run; clear --out dir or run fresh /product-foundation`; if v2 found, abort with `state v2 found — older /product-foundation run; clear --out dir or run fresh /product-foundation`; (b) `slug`/`idea`/`flags.stack` match the invocation; if mismatch, abort with `state mismatch — clear --out dir or pick different --from-step`. If both pass, jump to step NN.
     - Else (no `--from-step` OR no `.state.json`): prompt `<out> exists with prior /product-foundation artifacts. Overwrite the non-harness artifacts? (.git/ history and the runtime harness are preserved) (y/N) ▷`. On `y` → run `bash <this-skill-dir>/scripts/clear-target.sh <out>`, which removes every top-level entry NOT in the harness allowlist (the `<remaining>` set) — `.git/` history and the runtime harness survive; the removed paths surface as deletions in the operator's post-run `git diff` (the audit trail). On `n` / no answer → abort cleanly with `aborted; pick a different --out or rm the existing dir yourself`. Exit 0.

   **Harness allowlist drift:** the path list above is mirrored in the `ALLOWLIST` constant in `<this-skill-dir>/scripts/clear-target.sh` (the script the overwrite invokes). Keep the two in sync — otherwise a new harness file would falsely trigger the overwrite prompt, or be deleted outright by `clear-target.sh`.

2. **Init** — `mkdir -p <out>/docs/screens/hifi <out>/docs/prd <out>/docs/design-system <out>/docs/specs <out>/docs/.quality`; write fresh `<out>/docs/.state.json` per `state-machine.md` v6 shape with `version=6, phase="discovery", step=0, started_at=<ISO>, gates_passed=[], completed_steps=[], blocked_steps=[], iterations={concept:0, discovery:0, specification:0, identity:0}, quality_verdicts={}, completed_at=null, target_language=null, product_form=null`. **Artifact layout discipline:** `/product-foundation` produces a docs-first foundation, NOT a runnable app. EVERY skill-produced output writes under `<out>/docs/` — pipeline deliverables semantic-named (`docs/concept-brief.md`, `docs/sitemap.yaml`, `docs/system-design.md`, etc. — NO `NN-` prefix), PRD release-scoped at `docs/prd/v1.md`, design system grouped at `docs/design-system/{tokens.css, components.md, README.md}`, lo-fi mood at `docs/screens/`, hi-fi mood at `docs/screens/hifi/`, the SDD specs at `docs/specs/`, the run report at `docs/REPORT.md`, the state file at `docs/.state.json`. The `<out>/` root holds only `docs/` and whatever runtime harness the project already carries (no `.mcp.json` is seeded). The runtime tree (`app/`, `lib/`, `package.json`, `node_modules/`, build config) does NOT exist after `/product-foundation` — the SDD foundation child (Phase 5) scaffolds it. Temporal ordering of pipeline steps survives via REPORT.md + .state.json; semantic naming wins for the founder's day-to-day mental model.

3. **No MCP seed.** `/product-foundation` does NOT write a live `<out>/.mcp.json`. The Phase 4 visual check drives the **agent-browser plugin** over `file://` (no server, no MCP, no session restart — see Phase 4 below). The pipeline never seeds an MCP.

## Phase 0.5 — Target language resolution — 🔒 Low freedom: detect or read user-supplied locale

Resolves `target_language` BEFORE Step 01 dispatches so every downstream sub-agent generates user-facing text in the right language. Runs ONCE per fresh run (skipped on `--from-step` resume — state already carries the value).

1. **Heuristic from idea string** — scan `<idea>` for signals:
   - Portuguese cues: any of `R$` / `LGPD` / `NFS-e` / `Pix` / `CNPJ` / `CPF` / `clínica` / `salão` / `petshop`, OR pt-BR diacritics (`á é í ó ú ã õ ç`) anywhere in the string → propose `pt-BR`.
   - Spanish cues: `€` (combined with `IVA` / `S.L.` / `México` / `España`), OR es diacritics (`ñ ¿ ¡`) → propose `es-ES` or `es-MX` (favor `es-ES` if ambiguous).
   - Otherwise → propose `en` (US default; `en-GB` only if `Ltd` / `programme` / `colour` appear).
2. **`AskUserQuestion` — single question, 2-4 options**:
   - Q: `Target language for all artifacts (PRD, brand-book, screen copy, etc)?`
   - Options: `<proposed> (Recommended)` · `en` · `pt-BR` · `Other` (founder types BCP-47 tag like `es-MX`, `fr-FR`, etc).
   - The (Recommended) label uses whichever the heuristic proposed.
3. **Store** — write `target_language` into `<out>/docs/.state.json` (BCP-47 string). This is now the canonical signal for every brief substitution + brand-book Step 13 § Language section.

**On `--from-step` resume:** read `.state.json.target_language`. If null (older state without language field), run the heuristic + ask. If present, use as-is (no re-ask).

**Override:** founder can edit `.state.json.target_language` between phases — downstream sub-agents read the current value at dispatch time, so changes mid-run propagate to subsequent steps (but artifacts already written stay in their original language until re-iterated).

## Layer-1 validation — the mechanical schema floor (runs BEFORE a step is recorded complete) — 🔒 Low freedom: deterministic

After a step's producer returns, the orchestrator runs the **Layer-1 floor check** on the produced artifact(s) **before** recording the step in `completed_steps` or advancing. This is the deterministic, mechanical gate; the quality judge (next section) is the orthogonal *semantic* verdict. It re-homes the validate-then-write invariant the dead pipeline-MCP used to enforce: the orchestrator validates the floors and a `schema-incomplete` artifact NEVER advances the pipeline.

```bash
bun <this-skill-dir>/scripts/validate-step.ts \
  <this-skill-dir>/templates/pipeline/<NN-step>/schema.md \
  <out>/docs/<primary-artifact> [<out>/docs/<extra-artifact> ...] --json
```

Pass the produced artifact files in the SAME ORDER as that step's `schema.md` `required_files[]` (primary first, then any `extra_files`). The checker parses the floor and verifies each file: it exists, meets its `min_size` anti-stub floor, contains every required anchor, and (when declared) at least one `any_of_contains` alternative.

- **Exit 0 (`code:"ok"` or `code:"no-floor"`)** → the floor passed (or the step declares none). Proceed: append the step to `completed_steps`, then run the quality judge.
- **Exit 1 (`code:"schema-incomplete"`)** → the artifact missed a floor; the `missing_or_invalid` list names exactly which file/anchor/size failed. **Do NOT append to `completed_steps`; do NOT advance.** Re-dispatch the step's producer with a brief naming the failures, then re-validate.

Multi-file bundle steps (`03-spec`, `08-system-design`, `14-design-system`) pass ALL their files in one call — if any fails, the bundle is `schema-incomplete` and the step does not advance (atomic at the step boundary). Two floors are NOT a plain file check and are enforced additionally per their `schema.md`/`prompt.md`: the Step 07 sitemap `required_categories` per-category minimums, and the Step 04 `validation_mode:` line (the orchestrator extracts it into `.state.json.validation_mode` after the floor passes).

## Quality judge — runs once per phase, batched — 🔒 Low freedom: canonical rubric, deterministic verdict

After a phase's step producers return, the orchestrator grades the phase's artifacts with the **quality judge** — ONE independent batched sub-agent per phase — before building the report and reaching the gate. The judge is the scope/quality verdict that replaced the retired size budget; it answers *"is this artifact correctly scoped, complete, and coherent for its declared job?"* per judge-unit, plus a batch-level cross-consistency read across the phase's artifacts. Model per phase-batch (provisional mix per `quality-judge.md § Cost & model mix`): Phase 1 + 3 → `sonnet`; Phase 2 + 4 → `opus`. Full contract: `references/quality-judge.md`. Each phase's "Update `.state.json`" step invokes this routine over that phase's steps.

The phase's **judge-units** are: steps 01-14 = the step; Step 15 = `15a-screen-atlas` / `15b-hifi-mood` / `15c-fixture-spec`.

1. **Anti-stub pre-filter (per unit).** `wc -c` each step's required artifacts against the `min_size` in `templates/pipeline/<NN-step>/schema.md § Size floor`. Below floor → the artifact is a **stub**: re-dispatch the step's producer with a brief naming the stubbed artifact, and EXCLUDE that unit from the batch (judge it after it un-stubs). (A 200 KB runaway is circuit-broken upstream by the producer brief's catastrophe cap — the judge never receives one.)
1b. **Craft-floor pre-check (judge-units `02-prototype` + `15b-hifi-mood` ONLY).** Before dispatching the judge for these two authored-visual units, run the deterministic anti-slop check over the unit's HTML artifacts and capture its JSON: `bun <this-skill-dir>/scripts/craft-floor-check.ts --design <bound design-systems/<vendor>/DESIGN.md> <html...> --json > <out>/docs/.quality/craft-floor-<step_label>.json`. Artifacts: `02-prototype` → `<out>/docs/direction-*.html`; `15b-hifi-mood` → `<out>/docs/screens/hifi/*.html`. This is advisory plumbing — it never blocks; it just produces findings the judge reads. Skip entirely for all other judge-units. (See `references/craft-floor.md`.)
2. **Dispatch the batched judge.** ONE `Agent` call for the phase per `references/delegation-briefs.md § Quality judge` — `model: <phase mix: sonnet P1/P3, opus P2/P4>`, `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Substitute `{{phase_label}}`, `{{judge_model}}`, `{{judge_units}}` (one entry per non-stubbed unit: `step_label` / `artifact_paths` / `schema_dir` (`<this-skill-dir>/templates/pipeline/<NN-step>/`) / `rubric_section` (the `### NN — <name>` heading in `quality-checklist.md`) / `verdict_path` (`<out>/docs/.quality/<step_label>.json`)), `{{out}}`. **For `02-prototype` / `15b-hifi-mood`, also pass the craft-floor JSON path from step 1b** in that unit's entry so the judge grades `craft-floor` against `summary.active_p0` (fail iff > 0) rather than re-discovering tells. The judge writes one verdict file per unit — never a combined file.
3. **Merge the verdicts.** Read each `<out>/docs/.quality/<step_label>.json`, stamp `model` with the dispatched model, and write it into `<out>/docs/.state.json` `quality_verdicts[<step_label>]` (a map — a re-judged step overwrites its key).
4. **Route by `outcome`** (per `quality-judge.md § Verdict → gate routing`):
   - `pass` — recorded only.
   - `concern` — recorded; surfaces in `REPORT.md § Quality concerns` (advisory, no gate action).
   - `fail` — recorded; surfaces in `REPORT.md § Quality concerns`; AND flags the phase's downstream gate (below).

**Verdict → phase-gate routing.** At a phase gate (`gate_discovery` / `gate_specification` / `gate_identity`), before invoking `AskUserQuestion`, collect every `quality_verdicts` entry for that phase's steps. If any has `outcome: "fail"`, the gate's **recommended** option is `iterate`, and the `iterate` sub-prompt is pre-filled with the failed steps + their failed criteria — the human still chooses `continue` / `iterate` / `abort` (the judge never decides). If none failed, `continue` stays recommended. The iteration soft-cap (`state-machine.md § Gate UX` — warn at 3, force-abort at 5) still bounds the loop.

**Phase 4 has no gate** — a `15a`/`15b`/`15c` `fail` cannot pre-populate a gate, so it surfaces in `REPORT.md § Quality concerns` and the Phase 5 terminal handoff message.

The judge never autonomously BLOCKs or aborts — deterministic structural BLOCK/abort stays the `schema.md` Layer 1 + orchestrator job (`delegation-briefs.md § Failure handling`). A judge `fail` is orthogonal to BLOCKED: a step in `completed_steps` can still carry a `fail` verdict.

## Phase 1 — Discovery (pipeline steps 01-04) — 🔓 Medium freedom: content adapts to detected scope

**Read `references/delegation-briefs.md` § "Phase 1 — Discovery" BEFORE dispatching.** Each Agent call uses the 5-field template there.

1. **Step 01 — Ideation** (BLOCKING) — dispatch Sub-agent A per § Step 01 brief. **model: opus.** Returns `<out>/docs/concept-brief.md` (includes `§ Product Form` — the binding form-factor declaration — and `§ Market Sizing` framed as pre-validation hypothesis). If BLOCKED: ABORT the entire run.
1b. **Capture `product_form`** — parse the concept brief's `**Form:**` line (`§ Product Form`); write the value (`screen-app | headless-service | cli | bot | embedded`) to `<out>/docs/.state.json.product_form`. If the line is missing or names an unknown form, re-dispatch Step 01 with a brief naming the gap (this is a structural miss, not a judge matter).
1c. **Gate — `gate_concept`** — the cheapest kill/redirect point, BEFORE any further step spends tokens. `AskUserQuestion`: `Did the concept brief capture your idea? Review <out>/docs/concept-brief.md — especially § Product Form (<value>) and the riskiest bets.` Options:
   - `continue` → proceed to Step 02 (append `concept` to `gates_passed`).
   - `adjust` → user states the correction (sub-prompt); re-dispatch Step 01 with the correction appended to the brief; re-run 1b; re-gate. Increment `iterations.concept`.
   - `abort` → exit cleanly; set `flags.from_step = 1`; print resume command.
   No judge verdict feeds this gate (the judge has not run yet) — the founder's own read is the input.
2. **Step 02 — Prototype v1 (lo-fi)** — dispatch direction-writer per § Step 02 brief. Returns `<out>/docs/direction-a.html` + 3-5 killer-flow HTML mood screens at `<out>/docs/screens/NN-<name>.html`. Note: sitemap is NO LONGER produced at Step 02 (moved to its own Step 07 — sitemap-IA). Step 02 outputs are pure mood/visual exploration of the killer flow.
3. **Step 03 alone, then Step 04 alone** (NOT parallel). Step 03 produces `functional-spec.md`; Step 04's CONTEXT explicitly reads `functional-spec.md` (audit input), so the two dispatches MUST NOT share a single message. Dispatch Step 03 per § Step 03 brief (`sonnet`; extends with § Assumption Register); after Step 03 returns, dispatch Step 04 per § Step 04 brief (`sonnet`).
4. **Layer-1 validate → update `.state.json` → run the quality judge** — for EACH of Steps 01-04, run the Layer-1 floor check (§ Layer-1 validation) on its artifact(s); a `schema-incomplete` step is re-dispatched and NOT recorded. Only floor-passing steps append to `completed_steps`; any BLOCKED to `blocked_steps`; then run the **quality judge** over Steps 01-04 per § Quality judge (anti-stub pre-filter → judge dispatch → merge verdicts into `quality_verdicts` → route).
5. **Build the HTML report** — run `bun <this-skill-dir>/scripts/build-report.ts --out=<out> --slug=<slug> --stack=<stack>`. Regenerates `<out>/docs/REPORT.html` — the navigable reading surface for every artifact produced so far (steps not yet run render as greyed-out "not yet generated"). Best-effort: if `bun` is unavailable or the script errors, emit a one-line `report-html-skipped: <reason>` advisory and continue — this never blocks the gate.
6. **Gate — `gate_discovery`** — `AskUserQuestion` with 3 options. **Review agenda first:** before the question, present the 3-5 decisions actually worth the founder's eye this phase — load-bearing choices the artifacts made (e.g. the riskiest assumption + its abandon signal from the register, the killer-flow framing, a deferred surface) + every judge `concern`/`fail` note from `quality_verdicts`, each as one line with the artifact path. Assembled from already-generated material; the `<out>/docs/REPORT.html` link follows for deep review. Per § Quality judge, if any Step 01-04 `quality_verdicts` entry has `outcome: "fail"`, the **recommended** option is pre-set to `iterate` (citing the failed step + criterion); otherwise `continue` is recommended:
   - `continue` → proceed to Phase 2 — Specification (append `discovery` to `gates_passed`).
   - `iterate` → user names which step(s) to re-dispatch (sub-prompt). Re-dispatches with augmented brief. Increment `iterations.discovery`. Re-gate after.
   - `abort` → exit cleanly; set `flags.from_step = current_step`; print resume command.

## Phase 2 — Specification (pipeline steps 05-12) — 🔓 Medium freedom: artifact content adapts to phase-1 outputs

The biggest phase (8 steps). Internal dispatch DAG follows dependency order; some parallelize, others are strictly serial.

1. **Step 05 — PRD 1-pager** (BLOCKING; downstream depends on US-NN stable IDs). Dispatch per § Step 05 brief. Returns `<out>/docs/prd/v1.md` in Lenny 1-pager hybrid shape (Problem · Why now · Success metrics with NSM slot · Solution sketch · User stories · Anti-goals + 3 our-specific: Release scope · NSM-dedicated-slot · Upstream/downstream refs). 4-7 KB tight target.
2. **Steps 06 + 07 — parallel fan-out** — dispatch TWO sub-agents in ONE MESSAGE per § Step 06 (OST) + § Step 07 (sitemap-IA) briefs. Both read Step 05 PRD. Step 06 = Opportunity Solution Tree (Teresa Torres methodology). Step 07 = full screen inventory YAML with schema-bound `required_categories`.
3. **Step 07 acceptance check** — orchestrator parses returned `<out>/docs/sitemap.yaml` and enforces `references/sitemap-schema.md` § required_categories: every category in `[marketing, auth, primary, admin, error]` must have ≥1 route OR be explicitly listed in top-level `deferred_categories: [{name, reason}]`. **If any required category has 0 routes AND no deferral, BLOCK Step 07 + re-dispatch with augmented brief naming the missing category(ies).** This is the load-bearing mechanical fix for the Pass-E silent-undercover bug.
4. **Step 08 — System design** (depends on Step 05 PRD + Step 07 sitemap). Dispatch per § Step 08 brief. Returns `<out>/docs/system-design.md` + `<out>/docs/security.md` + `<out>/docs/data-flow.json` (the data-flow inventory consumed by Step 09 legal for DPIA trigger). Extended with § RACI Matrix + § Risk Register per Decision 10.
5. **Step 09 — Legal posture** (depends on Step 08 data-flow inventory — shift-left per Decision 4). Dispatch per § Step 09 brief. Reads `<out>/docs/data-flow.json` for DPIA trigger; if data-flow includes sensitive categories (PII / health / minors / financial), DPIA section becomes mandatory. Returns `<out>/docs/legal-posture.md`.
6. **Step 10 — Roadmap** (depends on Step 05 PRD priorities + Step 08 dependencies). Dispatch per § Step 10 brief. Returns `<out>/docs/roadmap.md` with phase definitions that **drive** the next step's cost calculation. **Cost↔roadmap ordering — roadmap dispatches BEFORE cost so cost calculates per-phase from real phase boundaries instead of inventing implicit ones.**
7. **Steps 11 + 12 — parallel fan-out** — dispatch TWO sub-agents in ONE MESSAGE per § Step 11 (cost) + § Step 12 (gtm-launch) briefs. Step 11 reads Step 10 roadmap (for phase boundaries) + Step 09 legal (for review budget) + Step 08 system-design (for integration line items). Step 12 reads Step 10 (for launch timing) + Step 09 (for compliance signals).
8. **Layer-1 validate → update `.state.json` → run the quality judge** — for EACH of Steps 05-12, run the Layer-1 floor check (§ Layer-1 validation) on its artifact(s) before recording it; a `schema-incomplete` step is re-dispatched, NOT recorded. Then record completed/blocked steps; then run the **quality judge** over Steps 05-12 per § Quality judge.
9. **Build the HTML report** — run `build-report.ts` as in Phase 1 step 5; regenerates `<out>/docs/REPORT.html`. Best-effort, never blocks.
10. **Gate — `gate_specification`** — `AskUserQuestion` (same 3-option shape). **Review agenda first** (same shape as `gate_discovery`): the 3-5 load-bearing decisions this phase made — e.g. the pricing model + price point, the stack pin from § Stack, deferred sitemap categories, the DPIA posture — plus every judge `concern`/`fail` note; then the `<out>/docs/REPORT.html` link for deep review. Per § Quality judge, a `fail` among the Step 05-12 `quality_verdicts` pre-sets the recommended option to `iterate`.

## Phase 3 — Identity (pipeline steps 13-14) — 🔓 Medium freedom: brand/design content adapts to product domain

Strictly serial — design system depends on brand.

1. **Step 13 — Brand book.** Dispatch per § Step 13 brief. Returns `<out>/docs/brand-book.md`. If `--skip-brand`: skip dispatch, `cp templates/default-tokens.css <out>/docs/design-system/tokens.css` + write minimal `<out>/docs/brand-book.md` with neutral tone. **Brand moves to Phase 3 per Decision 3 (PRD-first ordering)** — brand-book now consumes a finalized PRD + sitemap + system-design, NOT a half-formed concept brief.
2. **Step 14 — Design system.** Dispatch per § Step 14 brief. Reads brand-book + audit findings (Step 04) + sitemap inventory (Step 07). Returns 3 files: `docs/design-system/tokens.css`, `docs/design-system/components.md`, `docs/design-system/README.md`.
3. **Layer-1 validate → update `.state.json` → run the quality judge** — for Steps 13-14, run the Layer-1 floor check (§ Layer-1 validation) before recording; a `schema-incomplete` step is re-dispatched, NOT recorded. Then record completed/blocked steps; then run the **quality judge** over Steps 13-14 per § Quality judge.
4. **Build the HTML report** — run `build-report.ts` as in Phase 1 step 5; regenerates `<out>/docs/REPORT.html`. Best-effort, never blocks.
5. **Gate — `gate_identity`** — `AskUserQuestion`. **Review agenda first** (same shape): the 3-5 identity decisions worth the eye — the product-name commit (or placeholder), the we-are/we-are-not pair, the token-vendor lineage — plus every judge `concern`/`fail` note; then the `<out>/docs/REPORT.html` link. Per § Quality judge, a `fail` among the Step 13-14 `quality_verdicts` pre-sets the recommended option to `iterate`.

## Phase 4 — Visual contract (pipeline step 15) — 🔓 Medium freedom: screen atlas size adapts to sitemap scope

NO GATE — Phase 4 closes the visual-contract phase; Phase 5 (the mandatory SDD handoff) is the pipeline's terminal step.

The v2/v3 per-route screen-writer fan-out is **deleted**. `/product-foundation` writes NO `app/` tree, NO `page.tsx` / `layout.tsx`, runs NO `pnpm install` / build verification / dev-server smoke-test. The runnable app is built by the SDD children scaffolded in Phase 5. **Form variant:** for a non-`screen-app` `product_form`, the three sub-agents produce the form's interface contract per `references/product-forms.md § Phase 4` — same artifact names, paths, floors, and judge-units; the inventory unit (endpoints / commands / intents / host touchpoints) and the rendered content change. The briefs carry `{{product_form}}`. Step 15 dispatches the three sub-agents in **two waves**: wave A = 15a + 15c **in one message** (parallel — distinct output paths, no shared inputs); wave B = 15b after 15c returns (the Mood-screen-writer brief in hi-fi mode reads `fixture-spec.md`, so 15b CANNOT share a message with 15c). Then run a best-effort visual check, then authors REPORT.md.

1. **Wave A — dispatch Step 15a + Step 15c in one message** (two parallel `Agent` calls per `references/delegation-briefs.md § Phase 4`):
   - **Step 15a — Screen atlas** — per § Step 15a brief. Returns `<out>/docs/screen-atlas.md` — the navigable visual-contract document indexing every sitemap route, PRD coverage, states coverage, the killer-flow walkthrough. **No `app/` writes, no layout files.**
   - **Step 15c — Fixture spec** — per § Step 15c brief. Returns `<out>/docs/fixture-spec.md` — one persona, one coherent entity set, internally consistent dates.

   **Wave B — after Step 15c returns, dispatch Step 15b:**
   - **Step 15b — Hi-fi killer-flow mood** — dispatch the § Mood-screen-writer brief in **hi-fi mode** (`{{mood_tier}}=hi-fi`), once per killer-flow screen. The screens are the same 3-5 the Step 02 lo-fi mood covered — read them from `<out>/docs/screens/` + Step 02's REPORT § Turn 2 Plan. The hi-fi brief reads `fixture-spec.md` for on-brand data, which is why 15b runs after 15c (not parallel with it). Cap 5 concurrent across the killer-flow screens themselves. Returns `<out>/docs/screens/hifi/<NN>-<name>.html` × 3-5 — brand+tokens-applied, mobile-first static HTML.
2. **Layer-1 validate → update `.state.json` → run the quality judge** — run the Layer-1 floor check (§ Layer-1 validation) on `screen-atlas.md` (Step 15a) before recording; a `schema-incomplete` atlas is re-dispatched, NOT recorded. Then append `15-screen-atlas` to `completed_steps`; record any BLOCKED to `blocked_steps` (per `delegation-briefs.md § Failure handling`: 15a BLOCKED → ABORT the run; 15b / 15c BLOCKED → degrade gracefully, Phase 5 still runs). Then run the **quality judge** over the three judge-units `15a-screen-atlas` / `15b-hifi-mood` / `15c-fixture-spec` per § Quality judge. Phase 4 has no gate — a `fail` surfaces in `REPORT.md § Quality concerns` + the Phase 5 handoff message, not a gate `iterate`.
3. **Best-effort visual check (via the agent-browser plugin).** This skill bundles NO browser — the visual check is delegated to the **agent-browser plugin** (a declared optional dependency). It navigates `file://` natively, so there is NO localhost HTTP server and NO MCP.

   - **Availability gate (fail-closed).** The agent-browser plugin is present iff its launcher shim resolves — `.tachyon/bin/_tachyon-tool agent-browser agent-browser --help` exits 0:

     ```bash
     if .tachyon/bin/_tachyon-tool agent-browser agent-browser --help >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       AB=yes; else AB=no; fi
     ```

   - **When available (`AB=yes`).** For each hi-fi screen in `<out>/docs/screens/hifi/*.html`, drive the agent-browser plugin over a stable session (`AB=".tachyon/bin/_tachyon-tool agent-browser agent-browser"`):

     ```bash
     S="pf-visual"
     "$AB" --session "$S" open "file://<abs-path-to-screen.html>"
     "$AB" --session "$S" resize 375 812;  "$AB" --session "$S" screenshot "<out>/docs/.quality/visual-audit/<name>-375.png"
     "$AB" --session "$S" resize 1280 900; "$AB" --session "$S" screenshot "<out>/docs/.quality/visual-audit/<name>-1280.png"
     ```

     Read each capture and note any obvious horizontal overflow (content wider than the viewport) per screen for REPORT.md § Visual check. (The exact verb list is in the agent-browser skill's own `SKILL.md`; `resize` may be `set-viewport` depending on the CLI version — read it if a verb errors. Reads are frictionless; this flow takes no state-mutating action.) Hi-fi mood screens are fragments that legitimately have no single `h1` / `main` landmark — judge layout/overflow, not document structure.

   - **When unavailable (`AB=no`)** — the plugin isn't installed or host Chrome is missing — emit `visual-gate-skipped: agent-browser plugin unavailable — install the agent-browser plugin to enable the visual check` and record the skip **prominently** in REPORT.md § Visual check. **Best-effort — never blocks, never aborts, never falls back to an MCP.**
4. **Author `<out>/docs/REPORT.md` inline.** Read `templates/report.md.tmpl`, substitute placeholders from `<out>/docs/.state.json` + the phase outputs. Fill the `## Quality concerns` section from `.state.json` `quality_verdicts` — every `concern`/`fail` criterion with its `note`, plus each judge-unit's `scope_assessment` (per `quality-judge.md § Verdict → gate routing`). See `quality-judge.md` + `quality-checklist.md` for the rubric.

## Phase 5 — Mandatory SDD handoff — 🔒 Low freedom: umbrella matrix template + foundation child scaffold

`/product-foundation` does not end at a chat message — it scaffolds the engineering entry point. **Read `references/sdd-handoff.md` before executing this phase** — it is the full contract for what to write and how to fill it from the pipeline artifacts.

> **Reconcile with UI acceptance (spec 206).** The `screen-atlas.md` + `fixture-spec.md` this pipeline produces are **design-time** artifacts (the intended UI). They are **input for writing the SDD children's UI tests** — design source material, never implementation-acceptance proof. When the scaffolded SDD children build the UI, their acceptance is a **green project UI test** covering the changed surface (declared with `UI impact: none|ui`), authored *from* the screen-atlas + fixture-spec. There is no design-time→implementation-bundle reconciliation and no frozen acceptance artifact — the retired visual-contract gate died with spec 206.

1. **Scaffold the umbrella spec** at `<out>/docs/specs/001-<slug>/` — copy the four `<sdd-skill-dir>/templates/*.tmpl` files, substitute `{{NNN}}=001` / `{{SLUG}}=<slug>` / `{{DATE}}`, then FILL `spec.md` per `sdd-handoff.md § The umbrella spec` and § What Phase 5 produces. **Read `docs/system-design.md` (especially § Stack, § Services, § Trade-off Triggers / Open Decisions) + `docs/roadmap.md` Fase 1 `| Deliverable | Owner | Status |` rows before computing the matrix.** Emit infra children for Fase 1 deliverables that don't map to any per-phase visual child — block-precede numbering (children #3..M are infra, then per-phase visual children #(M+1)..N). Every Fase 1 row maps to a child OR appears in umbrella OQs as `**Deferral reason:**` — no Fase 1 deliverable is silently orphaned. Copy every row from `docs/system-design.md § Trade-off Triggers → Open Decisions` into the umbrella `## Open questions` prefixed `**Architecture — <topic>:**` (see `sdd-handoff.md § Open questions migration` for the shape). Header is `**Type:** umbrella`; fill `## Standing constraints` per `sdd-handoff.md § Standing constraints` (stack-conditional styling / no inline `style` for layout / mobile-first / fixture coherence / a green project UI test for built UI — see the project conventions). `plan.md` / `tasks.md` / `notes.md` stay as template scaffolds — the matrix in `spec.md` is the umbrella's tracking surface.
2. **Scaffold the foundation child** at `<out>/docs/specs/002-foundation/` — copy the four templates, substitute `{{NNN}}=002` / `{{SLUG}}=foundation` / `{{DATE}}`, then FILL `spec.md` per the rewritten `sdd-handoff.md § Child #1` (research-driven). The foundation child's `spec.md § Context` mandates research at `/sdd plan` time — no bundled template is consumed. § Acceptance is stack-neutral (dev server starts clean, typecheck/lint exit 0, token utility resolves). `plan.md` / `tasks.md` / `notes.md` stay as scaffolds — the founder runs `/sdd plan` then `/sdd tasks` on this child.
3. **Children #2..N are matrix rows only** — listed in the umbrella's child-spec matrix, NOT pre-scaffolded. Child #2 (component-library) names `docs/design-system/components.md` as its input spec. Children #3..M (when present) are infra, derived from `docs/roadmap.md` Fase 1 unmatched deliverables; children #(M+1)..N are per-phase visual children sliced by `docs/roadmap.md` phases. If `docs/roadmap.md` has no usable phase structure, fall back to a single `app-build` child per `sdd-handoff.md § Fallback`.
4. **Finalize `<out>/docs/.state.json`** — set `phase="sdd-handoff"`, `completed_at=<ISO timestamp>`.
5. **Build the terminal HTML report** — run `bun <this-skill-dir>/scripts/build-report.ts --out=<out> --slug=<slug> --stack=<stack>`. This is the final regeneration — `<out>/docs/REPORT.html` now covers the full 15-step pipeline plus the SDD-handoff specs. Best-effort: a `bun`/script failure emits a one-line `report-html-skipped: <reason>` advisory and does not abort the run.
6. **Print the handoff message:**

```
Product foundation ready at <out>/.

  Pipeline coverage: 15/15 steps completed (or N/15 if any BLOCKED — see docs/REPORT.md § Blocked steps).
  Report:        <out>/docs/REPORT.md
  Report (HTML): <out>/docs/REPORT.html          <-- navigable reading surface (open in a browser)
  Concept brief: <out>/docs/concept-brief.md
  PRD:           <out>/docs/prd/v1.md
  Sitemap:       <out>/docs/sitemap.yaml
  Screen atlas:  <out>/docs/screen-atlas.md      <-- the visual contract
  Hi-fi mood:    <out>/docs/screens/hifi/        <-- 3-5 rendered killer-flow screens
  Fixture spec:  <out>/docs/fixture-spec.md
  Full pipeline artifacts: <out>/docs/

  Phase wall-clock: <total elapsed from started_at to completed_at>
  Gate iterations: concept=<n> discovery=<n> specification=<n> identity=<n>
  Quality concerns: <count of concern+fail criteria across all quality_verdicts> (see docs/REPORT.md § Quality concerns)

  If you hand-edit an upstream document later (e.g. the PRD), run the staleness checker
  to see which downstream artifacts went stale and which --from-step refreshes them:
    bun <this-skill-dir>/scripts/staleness-check.ts --out=<out>
  (advisory only — it never regenerates or blocks anything)

  ENGINEERING HANDOFF — the app build runs as SDD specs (no runnable app was generated):
    Umbrella:         <out>/docs/specs/001-<slug>/spec.md      (Type: umbrella — tracks the whole v1 build)
    Infra children:   <out>/docs/specs/003-* … 00N-*           (N infra children — backbone first, per the umbrella matrix)   <-- conditional: only when infra children exist; omit entirely for simple-visual case
    Start here:       <out>/docs/specs/002-foundation/         (child #1 — research-driven; /sdd plan researches the stack declared in docs/system-design.md § Stack)

  Next: work the foundation child (/sdd plan -> /sdd tasks -> implement),
  then materialize each umbrella child-matrix row via /sdd new <phase-slug>.

  Optional after first release: wire production signals into reviewable
  maintenance work (a post-launch maintenance loop). That is standalone
  guidance, not a /product-foundation phase or installed runtime integration.
```

## Worked example — parallel dispatch in a single message

True parallelism (no FS race) happens when sub-agents have **no shared input AND distinct output paths**: Phase 2 Step 06+07 (both read Step 05 PRD only), Phase 2 Step 11+12 (both read Step 09 legal + Step 10 roadmap), and **Phase 4 wave A — Step 15a + Step 15c** (atlas / fixture-spec — no shared input, distinct output paths). Steps with strict serial dependencies (05 → 06+07 → 08 → 09 → 10 → 11+12) must NOT be dispatched together — they'd race the FS.

**Anti-parallelism — sub-agents whose CONTEXT names another's DELIVERABLE**:
- **Step 03 → Step 04**: Step 04's brief CONTEXT explicitly reads `functional-spec.md` (Step 03's deliverable). Dispatch Step 03 alone first; after it returns, dispatch Step 04 alone.
- **Step 15c → Step 15b**: the Mood-screen-writer brief in hi-fi mode CONTEXT explicitly reads `fixture-spec.md` (Step 15c's deliverable). Dispatch Step 15a + Step 15c in one message (wave A — safe); after Step 15c returns, dispatch Step 15b (wave B — serial).

Example (Phase 4 wave A — 2 parallel calls for Step 15a + 15c):

```
[single assistant message with two <tool_use> blocks]:
  <tool_use name="Agent" id="A1">
    subagent_type: general-purpose
    model: sonnet
    description: Step 15a — screen-atlas
    prompt: <TASK + CONTEXT + CONSTRAINTS + DELIVERABLE + DONE_WHEN per delegation-briefs.md § Step 15a>
  </tool_use>
  <tool_use name="Agent" id="A2">
    subagent_type: general-purpose
    model: sonnet
    description: Step 15c — fixture-spec
    prompt: <... per § Step 15c>
  </tool_use>
```

Then in a SECOND message (after A2 returns), wave B dispatches the killer-flow fan-out:

```
[single assistant message with up to 5 <tool_use> blocks — one per killer-flow screen]:
  <tool_use name="Agent" id="B1..B5">
    description: Step 15b — hi-fi mood screen <NN> (one call per killer-flow screen, cap 5)
    prompt: <... per § Mood-screen-writer, {{mood_tier}}=hi-fi — reads fixture-spec.md from A2>
  </tool_use>
```

Dispatching serially when safe to parallelize (one Agent call per message for sub-agents with no shared input) is a v1 orchestration bug. Wall-time penalty alone (~3× for a quad) makes parallel-where-safe critical.

**Anti-pattern**: do NOT dispatch Step 02 + Step 03 + Step 04 in one message. Step 03 and Step 04 CONTEXT both reference `<out>/docs/direction-a.html` + `<out>/docs/screens/` — those files don't exist when Step 02 hasn't returned. The de-facto-correct dispatch is Step 02 alone first, then Step 03 alone, then Step 04 alone (Step 04 reads Step 03's `functional-spec.md`).

## Unknown / extra subcommand

This skill does not have subcommands beyond the initial invocation. If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with an unrecognized token (not a quoted idea and not a flag), refuse with the usage hint:

```
/product-foundation "<idea>" --out=<path> [--stack=<name>] [--from-step=NN] [--skip-prd] [--skip-brand]
```

## Eval Scenarios

### Eval 1: Happy path — full multi-phase product

**Input:** User says `/product-foundation "ERP para salões de beleza Acme Yard" --stack=next --out=/home/user/acme-yard`.

**Expected:** Phase 0 idempotency check — `<out>` empty or harness-only → proceed; state initialized at v6 with `product_form=null`. Phase 0.5 locale resolved from idea language (pt-BR). Phase 1: Step 01 returns the concept brief with `§ Product Form` (screen-app for an ERP) + hypothesis-framed market sizing; `product_form` mirrored to state; **`gate_concept` fires before Step 02** (continue/adjust/abort); then steps 02-04 run serially where dependencies demand. ONE batched quality judge per phase (sonnet for Phases 1/3, opus for 2/4), writing one verdict file per judge-unit. Phase 2 fans out steps 05-12; roadmap/cost/GTM open with the `**Pre-validation projection.**` notice, cost figures as ranges. Phase 3 builds identity (steps 13-14); Phase 4 produces the screen atlas + hi-fi killer-flow mood (5-screen concurrency cap respected); Phase 5 scaffolds the SDD umbrella spec + foundation child reading system-design.md to compute the stack-aware matrix, and the handoff message mentions the staleness checker. Each phase gate opens with a 3-5 item review agenda, not just a report link. Output is a docs-first tree under `<out>` plus an SDD umbrella; NO app code, NO `pnpm install`, NO build verification.

**Failure indicators:** Pipeline ships a runnable app tree (`app/` / `apps/` / `package.json` at root). Step 02 dispatched without the concept gate having fired. functional-spec.md contains interview summaries presented as real conversations. 17 per-step judge calls instead of 4 phase batches. Mood-screen-writer fan-out exceeds 5 concurrent. Artifact rejected by quality judge but pipeline continues to next phase. `<out>` overwritten despite containing non-harness pre-existing files (idempotency check skipped). Visual contract dispatched before specification phase completes.

### Eval 2: MVP — selective skip flags

**Input:** User says `/product-foundation "MVP SaaS for solo entrepreneurs" --out=./mvp-saas --skip-brand`.

**Expected:** Phase 0/0.5 same as Eval 1. Brand step (within Phase 3) skipped with a one-line `--skip-brand active` advisory; downstream steps that would normally read brand artifacts (design-system step 14, atlas step 15) emit explicit warning that they're falling back to neutral defaults. PRD still ships (no `--skip-prd`); roadmap + cost + GTM all reference US-NN from the PRD. Pipeline still concludes with Phase 5 SDD handoff.

**Failure indicators:** Brand step silently skipped without downstream warning. PRD also dropped (user didn't pass `--skip-prd`). Design system step invents a brand from thin air instead of using neutral defaults. Phase 5 umbrella omits the foundation child because brand artifacts are missing.

### Eval 3: Resume mid-pipeline via `--from-step=NN`

**Input:** User says `/product-foundation "<idea>" --out=./existing-product --from-step=07` after a prior run aborted mid-pipeline.

**Expected:** Phase 0 idempotency detects non-empty `<out>`; resume-detection reads `<out>/docs/.state.json`, validates `version == 6` (v5 or older → abort with the clear-or-rerun message) and that `product_form` is set (steps past 01 depend on it). Pipeline restarts AT step 07 (sitemap-IA), reading already-produced step 01-06 artifacts as context. Steps before 07 NOT re-dispatched. Sitemap schema enforcement still applies against the declared form's category set (any member with 0 routes AND no `deferred_categories` declaration → BLOCK). Quality judge batches the remaining Phase 2 units when the phase closes.

**Failure indicators:** Phase 0 wipes `<out>` despite valid prior artifacts. Steps before 07 re-dispatched (token waste). Step 07 dispatched without reading step 06 (system-design.md) output. Sitemap schema check skipped on resume path.

## Notes

- **`/product-foundation` ends at the visual contract — it does NOT generate a runnable app.** Phase 4 produces `screen-atlas.md` + the hi-fi killer-flow mood (static HTML) + `fixture-spec.md`; Phase 5 scaffolds the SDD umbrella + foundation child. No `app/` tree, no `pnpm install`, no build verification. The app build is the founder working the scaffolded SDD specs. This is the deliberate fix for the v2/v3 36-route fan-out whose output quality collapsed (2026-05-19/20 dogfood).
- **Concurrency cap 5** for the mood-screen-writer fan-outs (Step 02 lo-fi, Step 15b hi-fi — both 3-5 screens, killer flow only). Proven non-OOM on a 17-route dogfood.
- **Output dir is `--out=<path>`**, NOT hardcoded `/tmp/`.
- **Standalone skill.** Bundled templates at `templates/pipeline/01-ideation/` … `15-screen-atlas/`. `/product-foundation` is the canonical delivery of the 15-step pipeline.
- **`--skip-prd` is degenerate.** PRD feeds Steps 06-15 (OST/sitemap/system-design/legal/roadmap/cost/GTM/brand/design-system/atlas all reference US-NN). Skipping produces a partial pipeline with downstream gaps marked in REPORT.md. Not recommended.
- **OD vendor bundled inside the skill.** 150 named `DESIGN.md` design systems at `<this-skill-dir>/design-systems/<vendor>/DESIGN.md`, plus 5-school prompts + frames + templates at `<this-skill-dir>/vendor/open-design/`, sync engine at `<this-skill-dir>/scripts/sync-open-design.ts` (`--check` / `--bump` / `--apply` / `--verify`). _(The `skills/` design-template bundle tree was dropped 2026-06-03 as pipeline-unread; consumed OD content is `design-systems/` + the catalogue.)_ Apache-2.0 attribution preserved in `vendor/open-design/{LICENSE,NOTICE}`. Lightweight catalogue at `<this-skill-dir>/references/od-catalog-index.json` (name + mood + palette + path) — Step 14 design-system brief reads it to pick 1-2 catalog vendors, then `Read`s the chosen `DESIGN.md` path directly. No MCP tool indirection; the skill is self-contained.
- **Artifact size discipline.** Artifact size is NOT a scope/quality signal — scope, completeness, and right-sizing are graded by the **quality judge** (§ Quality judge; `references/quality-judge.md`). The only size mechanisms left: each step's brief inlines the uniform 200 KB **catastrophe cap** (a token-runaway circuit-breaker), and each `schema.md § Size floor` carries a `min_size` anti-stub floor (the judge's `wc -c` pre-filter enforces it). The retired `× 1.2 / × 1.8` overshoot cascade and the per-step KB budget are gone. Trim-loop and re-emit-at-smaller-scope stay forbidden.
- **Sitemap schema enforcement is mechanical**. Orchestrator parses `<out>/docs/sitemap.yaml` after Step 07 returns; if any `required_categories` member has 0 routes AND no `deferred_categories: [{name, reason}]` declaration, Step 07 is BLOCKED. This is the load-bearing fix for the "atlas under-cover" bug Pass E demonstrated (Steward shipped without auth/admin/error screens silently).

# Pipeline coverage — 15 steps × 5 phases at "standard" tier (v0.6.0)

How `/product-foundation` v0.6.0 maps the 15-step industry-aligned product pipeline onto the 5 phases. **Single tier — "standard".** Lightening per step is fixed by this doc; no `--fast`/`--deep` flag soup.

**v0.6.0 honesty + fit:** Step 01 adds `§ Product Form` (binding form-factor declaration — `product-forms.md`) and reframes `§ Market Sizing` as explicit hypothesis; a **concept gate** (`gate_concept`) follows Step 01; Step 03's Problem-Validation Interviews are replaced by the `§ Assumption Register` (no fabricated evidence); Steps 10-12 open with a `**Pre-validation projection.**` notice (cost figures as ranges); the quality judge dispatches once per phase (batched, model-mixed per `quality-judge.md`); Step 02/07/14/15 adapt to the declared product form.

**v0.4.0 restructure:** Phase 4 no longer runs a per-route screen-writer fan-out — it ends at the visual contract (screen-atlas + hi-fi killer-flow mood + fixture-spec). The new Phase 5 mandatorily scaffolds the SDD umbrella + foundation child the engineering build runs as. `/product-foundation` produces a docs-first foundation, never a runnable app.

## Phase ↔ step map

| Phase | Pipeline steps | Gate at end? | Bulk wall-clock target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1 — Discovery** | 01-ideation · 02-prototype (lo-fi) · 03-spec · 04-validation | ✓ AskUserQuestion ×2 (`gate_concept` after Step 01 · `gate_discovery` at phase end) | 8-12 min |
| **Phase 2 — Specification** | 05-prd · 06-ost · 07-sitemap-ia · 08-system-design · 09-legal · 10-roadmap · 11-cost-estimate · 12-gtm-launch | ✓ AskUserQuestion (`gate_specification`) | 18-25 min |
| **Phase 3 — Identity** | 13-brand · 14-design-system | ✓ AskUserQuestion (`gate_identity`) | 6-10 min |
| **Phase 4 — Visual contract** | 15-screen-atlas (15a atlas · 15b hi-fi mood · 15c fixture-spec) | (no gate) | 5-8 min |
| **Phase 5 — SDD handoff** | scaffolds the umbrella + foundation child spec | (no gate; terminal) | 2-3 min |

**Total target: 35-55 min** end-to-end for a clean run. Add ~5 min per gate iteration if user picks `iterate`. The v0.4.0 restructure REMOVES the old worst-case multi-hour tail — there is no per-route screen-writer fan-out, no `pnpm install`, no build verification; Phase 4 is three parallel sub-agents and Phase 5 is local file scaffolding.

## Phase 5 — SDD handoff

Phase 5 has no step number — it is the terminal phase. `/product-foundation` scaffolds, under `<out>/docs/specs/`, the **umbrella spec** (`001-<slug>/`, `**Type:** umbrella`, child-spec matrix sliced by `roadmap.md` phases, standing constraints) plus the **foundation child** (`002-foundation/`, skeleton + tooling + route-group dirs + thin layout shells). Children #2..N are matrix rows, not pre-scaffolded. The full contract is `references/sdd-handoff.md`. This is the deliberate fix for the v2/v3 36-route fan-out whose output quality collapsed: `/product-foundation` hands a *contract* to SDD, which is built for deliberate harness-disciplined implementation.

Post-launch maintenance remains sibling infrastructure, not Phase 6. After a project ships, a post-launch maintenance loop can help wire production signals into human-reviewed agent maintenance work. `/product-foundation` may point to that pattern in its terminal handoff, but it does not install, operate, or require the loop.

## Per-step output + size floors (standard tier)

**The per-step `min_size` anti-stub floor lives in each step's `templates/pipeline/<NN-step>/schema.md`** — the `## Size floor` section + the Layer 1 `required_files` block. The `Size floor` column below is a **derived view**: when a floor changes, update the schema, not this table.

**Catastrophe cap (uniform 200 KB —):** artifact size is no longer a scope or quality signal. One uniform absolute cap of 200 KB applies to any artifact a sub-agent writes — past it, the sub-agent STOPs and emits a partial-result naming what it was producing. The cap is a dumb token-runaway circuit-breaker, not a budget: no per-step number, no overshoot multiplier. **Trim-loop and re-emit-at-smaller-scope stay forbidden** — both are "redo to fit budget" antipatterns that hide the scope-mismatch signal. The retired `1.2`/`1.8` overshoot cascade was a scope-blind fixed constant; empirical dogfood data proved it broken (10/10 overshoots, 0 true positives).

**Right-sizing is judged, not measured.** Whether an artifact is correctly scoped, complete, and right-sized for its declared job is the **quality judge**'s call — an independent sub-agent dispatched once per phase (batched over the phase's judge-units, model-mixed per `quality-judge.md § Cost & model mix`), grading each artifact against its step's rubric (`schema.md` required sections + `quality-checklist.md` criteria + a scope-aware right-sizing criterion + a batch-level cross-consistency read). See `references/quality-judge.md`. The `min_size` anti-stub floor below is the one cheap deterministic size check that remains — a `wc -c` stub-detector enforced at submit by each schema's Layer 1 block.

**Legend:**
- (legacy) = floor unchanged from earlier declaration; awaiting next-phase calibration when more dogfood data accumulates

**HTML report manifest:** the per-step artifact list above is mirrored — for rendering order only — by `ARTIFACT_MANIFEST` in `scripts/build-report.ts`, which generates the navigable `docs/REPORT.html` reading surface at each gate + the terminal step. That `const` is the single source of truth for the report's nav order; adding or removing a pipeline step means editing it alongside this table.

## Lightening op applied per step (single-tier "standard" decisions)

1. **01 Ideation:** 5-8 web searches (vs 15-25 canonical); skip `critique mode`. § Market Sizing — TAM/SAM/SOM as 1-paragraph each, NOT primary research, desk research with 1-2 cited sources per number, **framed as pre-validation hypothesis (ranges preferred; never presented as fact)**. **§ Product Form (v0.6.0):** binding form-factor declaration (`screen-app | headless-service | cli | bot | embedded`) the founder confirms at the concept gate; drives Steps 02/07/14/15 per `product-forms.md`.
2. **02 Prototype v1 (lo-fi):** ONE direction only (vs 3 mood boards); 3-5 killer-flow screens; **sitemap NO LONGER produced here** (moved to dedicated Step 07). Non-`screen-app` forms render the form's mood variant (terminal session / conversation thread / API walkthrough / host-chrome sketch — still static HTML) per `product-forms.md § Step 02`.
3. **03 Spec:** Combined `functional-spec.md` (no separate architecture.md). **§ Assumption Register (v0.6.0, replaces Problem-Validation Interviews):** 5-10 bets with risk type / confidence / basis + riskiest assumption + cheapest real-world test + abandon signal — written advice, never fabricated interview evidence; `value` rows seed OST opportunities with confidence tags.
4. **04 Validation:** Heuristic-only (Nielsen 10 + WCAG 2.1 AA top issues). Projected-mode default. Validation mode declaration required.
5. **05 PRD (1-pager):** Lenny bones (Problem · Why now · Success metrics · Solution sketch · User stories · Anti-goals) + 3 our-specific (Release scope · NSM-dedicated-slot · Upstream/downstream refs). TIGHT — each section ≤3 bullets to preserve 1-pager honesty. US-NN stable IDs (P0/P1/P2). ONE NSM in dedicated slot.
6. **06 OST:** 1 desired outcome (the NSM from PRD) → 3-5 opportunities (user problems discovered/inferred) → 2-3 solutions per opportunity (the "how"). Sibling artifact to PRD, NOT embedded — feeds the post-launch-review sibling tool when MCP-side ships it.
7. **07 Sitemap-IA:** YAML with schema-enforced `required_categories` — the set resolves from the declared product form per `product-forms.md § Step 07` (`screen-app`: `[marketing, auth, primary, admin, error]`). Each route has `path / category / states / covers_us / components`. Top-level `deferred_categories: [{name, reason}]` escape clause for genuinely-out-of-v1 categories (must include reason). Orchestrator parses + BLOCKS step if uncovered category found without deferral. **Mechanical fix for atlas under-cover (Pass E silent gap on auth/admin/error) — preserved for every form; only the ruler changes.**
8. **08 System Design:** Bridge-floor (6 sections: stack, integrations, data model, decisions locked, security, observability) + **NEW (Decision 10)**: § RACI Matrix + § Risk Register. Also produces `docs/data-flow.json` — structured data-flow inventory consumed by Step 09 legal for DPIA trigger.
9. **09 Legal:** Brief checklist (regulations, sub-processors, IP) + DPIA section IF Step 08 data-flow includes sensitive categories (PII/health/minors/financial). Reads `docs/data-flow.json` to determine DPIA trigger. **Shifted left per Decision 4** — informs Step 11 cost (legal review budget) + Step 12 GTM (compliance signals).
10. **10 Roadmap:** 3-phase sketch (MVP / Growth / Polish) with user-flow-shaped titles. **Defines phases for Step 11 cost** — cost calculates per-phase using THESE phase boundaries (not implicit ones). Opens with the `**Pre-validation projection.**` notice (v0.6.0).
11. **11 Cost Estimate:** Single-scenario burn rate, per-phase from Step 10's phase boundaries + Step 09's legal-review budget. Skip bear/base/bull + sensitivity + unit economics. Opens with the projection notice; **every `[Estimated]` figure presents as a range** (v0.6.0).
12. **12 GTM-launch:** Positioning canvas Dunford-lite (2-3 lines: who-for / alternative-to / why-better) + launch plan 4-week sketch (week-by-week milestones) + pricing strategy (free/standard/pro tier shape if relevant). Skip full launch playbook (post-PMF concern). Opens with the projection notice (v0.6.0).
13. **13 Brand:** 2-3 section snapshot (voice samples + visual direction posture + "we are/we are not" pair). Synthesizes from finalized PRD + sitemap + system-design (no longer from half-formed concept brief like v2). Skip founder-interview turn.
14. **14 Design System:** Catalog-path PREFERRED (1-2 vendors from `od-catalog-index.json`); custom-derive fallback. Resist token inflation (8-14 colors, 5-7 type scales). Non-`screen-app` forms scope per `product-forms.md § Step 14` (docs/terminal/message-template styling instead of UI component catalog).
15. **15 Visual contract:** Three sub-agents — (15a) `screen-atlas.md`, a navigable markdown contract indexing every sitemap route + PRD coverage; (15b) the hi-fi killer-flow mood, 3-5 brand+tokens-applied mobile-first static HTML screens; (15c) `fixture-spec.md`, the shared mock-data contract. **No per-route `page.tsx` set is generated** — the runnable app is built by the SDD children scaffolded in Phase 5. Non-`screen-app` forms produce the form's interface contract per `product-forms.md § Phase 4` (same artifact names/paths; the inventory unit + rendered content change).

## Bundled-template provenance + drift discipline

All 15 step prompts + schemas + references live at `.claude/skills/product-foundation/templates/pipeline/<step>/`. The skill is the canonical delivery.

**Why bundle (not symlink or runtime-read):** the skill is standalone — must work in any project. Bundle is the price of portability.

## Two-mood-pass rationale (lo-fi + hi-fi)

The 3-prototype-pass was collapsed into 2; both passes are **mood passes** (static HTML, not framework code):

- **Step 02 (Pass 1 — lo-fi mood):** Which visual direction resonates? Pre-brand, pre-tokens. Killer flow only. Mood HTML at `docs/screens/`.
- **Step 15b (Pass 2 — hi-fi mood):** Does the killer flow cohere with brand + tokens + audit fixes? Post-Specification + Identity. 3-5 brand+tokens-applied **mobile-first static HTML** screens at `docs/screens/hifi/` — the rendered half of the visual contract. The `screen-atlas.md` (Step 15a) is the prose half, spanning the full PRD coverage. **Real framework code is the SDD children's job (Phase 5)** deleted the per-route screen-writer fan-out that tried to generate it inline.

The deleted v2 Step 7 (prototype-v2 brand-tuned) was a redundant mid-step (3-stage felt over-engineered per Cagan SVPG "Flavors of Prototypes"). Its work (brand + tokens applied to killer-flow surfaces) is the Step 15b hi-fi mood.
